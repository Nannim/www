<p>General Gowon was overthrown in a palace coup in July 1975 and
        succeeded by General Murtala Muhammad, who was in turn assassinated in
        an abortive coup on February 13, 1976. He was replaced by Olusegun
        Obasanjo, formerly his second in command. General Obasanjo basically
        continued the policies and plans of the Muhammad regime.
        </p><p>Murtala Muhammad, a Hausa from the north (Kano State), ruled for only
        seven months. Within that short period, he endeared himself to most
        Nigerians because of his strong leadership and the radical reforms he
        introduced in domestic and foreign policies. He "purged" the
        public-service ministries, universities, parastatals, and other
        government agencies at the federal and state levels of individuals
        accused of being corrupt, indolent, or inefficient. He set up a panel
        headed by Justice Ayo Irikefe to advise on the creation of more states.
        Its report led to the creation of seven additional states in 1976.
        Murtala Muhammad also set up a panel under Justice Akintola Aguda to
        consider whether a new federal capital should be created because of the
        congestion in Lagos. The panel recommended Abuja in the southern part of
        the former Northern Region as the site of a new capital. In economic
        matters, Murtala Muhammad introduced the "low-profile" policy,
        a radical departure from the ostentation of the Gowon era.
        </p><p>Although he retained the framework of military federalism, Murtala
        Muhammad removed state governors from membership in the SMC and created
        a new body in which they were included at the center, the National
        Council of States. Because this body was chaired by the head of state
        and subordinate to the SMC, its creation underscored the subordinate
        position of the state governments. This arrangement enabled the head of
        state to exert greater control over the state governors than had been
        the case under Gowon. In the area of foreign policy, Murtala Muhammad
        pursued a vigorous policy that placed Africa at the center and that
        involved active support for liberation movements in the continent.
        </p><p>Of all Murtala Muhammad's actions, however, the one that had the most
        lasting consequences was a program of transition to civilian rule that
        he initiated before his death. The program was carried through as
        planned by his successor, Obasanjo. The stages of the transition agenda
        included the creation of more states, the reform of the local government
        system, the making of a new constitution, the formation of parties and,
        finally, the election of a new government. The transition process was to
        culminate in the handing over of power to civilians on October 1, 1979.
        </p><p>In February 1976, Murtala Muhammad was killed in an unsuccessful coup
        led by Colonel Bukar Dimka and officers from the middle belt; the coup
        appeared to be an attempt by middle-belt officers to bring back Gowon
        from his self-imposed exile and reinstate him as head of state.
        Obasanjo, a Yoruba and southerner, became head of state. Although
        unfavorably compared with Murtala Muhammad initially, he succeeded in
        many areas of his administration where the more intransigent Murtala
        Muhammad might have failed. Obasanjo became an adept political ruler,
        determined not to exacerbate north-south and Muslim-Christian schisms in
        the country.
        </p><p>In addition to its methodical conduct of all the stages of the
        transition to civilian government in 1979, the Obasanjo government
        initiated numerous reforms in public life. Attempts were made to
        introduce greater probity in the activities of civil servants and other
        public officials. The main vehicle for this process was the
        establishment of public complaints commissions in all states of the
        federation and in the capital. Despite the publicizing of particular
        cases of abuse of office and corruption, little progress was made in
        stopping the spread of this cancer in the society and economy.
        </p><p>The Obasanjo administration expanded the economic indigenization
        program started under Gowon. It also used the Land Use Decree of 1978 to
        rationalize the country's haphazard tenurial systems, to reduce the
        crippling land speculation and curb the frequent litigation over
        individual and communal property rights. It was hoped that these reforms
        would facilitate the acquisition of land for modern agricultural
        purposes. In a similar vein, the Obasanjo regime launched Operation Feed
        the Nation to counter the rapid rise in food exports. None of these
        efforts was successful, but the programs indicated the kind of
        strategies that Nigeria would have to adopt to alter its economic
        imbalances.
        </p><p>In view of the complex process of transition to civilian rule and the
        many reforms introduced in the four years of the Muhammad/Obasanjo
        governments, those regimes seemed in retrospect to have tried to do too
        much too soon. In the final year he was in power, Obasanjo introduced
        many austerity measures and insisted on a "low profile" for
        all government officials. He was aware that Nigeria, despite its oil
        wealth, was still largely an underdeveloped country and its
        businesspersons mainly agents or intermediaries for foreign businesses.
        Such a salutary attitude was soon forgotten, however, as the successor
        regime rode the crest of a renewed upsurge in oil prices, spent
        resources faster than they could be realized and left the country deeply
        in debt and its economy nearly in shambles when it ended in 1983.</p>
