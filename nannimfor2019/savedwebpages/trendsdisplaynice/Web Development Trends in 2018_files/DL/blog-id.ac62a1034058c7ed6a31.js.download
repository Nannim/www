The couple is happy spending all their free time with their kids. But they&rsquo;ve received a gift &ndash; two tickets to the local theater for a spectacular performance this weekend. The pair is excited about the evening, but there&rsquo;s one tiny problem. They urgently need to find someone to take care of the boys.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">John starts calling friends and Mary dials her parents. But unfortunately, nobody can help them out. Then John finds an ad for a babysitter who lives on the next street on the community jobs board. This seems like a good option, but suddenly there are so many questions. Is she reliable? Does she have experience with children of such age? Can she cook for the kids? All in all, can we trust our biggest treasure to a stranger?</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">In the end, Mary&rsquo;s sister comes to look after the boys and the husbands spend a marvelous evening in the theater.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">John and Mary were lucky to find a trusted person to take care of their children. But thousands of families face this problem every day and would appreciate a service that helps them find a reliable babysitter who has trustworthy reviews and is recommended by acquaintances.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Who can create the best babysitting solution? Someone who knows what parents face from his or her own experience, of course. And as a matter of fact, one such parent contacted Clockwise Software with an idea to develop an online marketplace for parents and babysitters for the Australian market. The name of this marketplace is Toddy.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">If you&rsquo;re new to the concept of marketplaces, <a href="/blog/how-to-build-an-online-marketplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a> on the rise of the sharing economy will answer all your questions.</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">What is Toddy?<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/how-to-build-an-online-marketplace-for-service/what is toddy.png" alt="" width="731" height="320" /></h2>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Toddy follows the classic marketplace model, connecting service providers (babysitters) with clients (parents). But there&rsquo;s one feature that makes Toddy different &ndash; the circle of trust.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The Toddy app displays all the connections that parents share with potential babysitters. These connections can be on Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter, in phone contacts, or through referrals. Parents can then ask people they know personally to give feedback so they can choose a trustworthy babysitter for their children.</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">Marketplace Development</h2>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Clockwise Software joined Toddy&rsquo;s development team and took over frontend development and testing. The backend team and project manager were part of Toddy&rsquo;s existing team, and worked remotely.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The frontend development required a complex approach. Our team&rsquo;s primary task was to build a high-performance application that would work well on different devices and different platforms. During development, we faced several challenges. Our solutions to these challenges reduced the development time and cost and resulted in some interesting features.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Hybrid approach to cut the time and cost of multi-platform app development<br />Our client planned to release Toddy for various platforms. Native app development is very time-consuming, so we suggested a hybrid approach with a focus on the iOS app first. We developed the application on the Cordova platform using Angular 2 and Ionic 2, which was in beta at the time. Hybrid app development allowed us to reduce the cost of the product as well as the time to market. <br /><br /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Our detailed comparison of native, hybrid, and web app development will give you an overview of this topic.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Native plugins to extend the limited functionality of the hybrid mobile appOne of the major drawbacks of hybrid applications is their limited access to a phone&rsquo;s native features. As some of Toddy&rsquo;s features were designed to access the phone&rsquo;s hardware, we had to implement several native plugins:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr"><a href="https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-push">Phonegap Push Plugin</a> to enable push notifications</li>\r\n<li dir="ltr"><a href="https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-geolocation">Cordova Geolocation Plugin</a> to provide information about a user&rsquo;s location</li>\r\n<li dir="ltr"><a href="https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-contacts">Cordova Contacts Plugin, </a>which provides access to the phone&rsquo;s contacts</li>\r\n<li dir="ltr"><a href="https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-camera">Cordova Camera Plugin</a>, which lets users take pictures or upload images from the phone&rsquo;s library</li>\r\n<li dir="ltr"><a href="https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Calendar-PhoneGap-Plugin">PhoneGap Calendar Plugin</a>, which allows users to add events to the phone&rsquo;s calendar</li>\r\n<li dir="ltr"><a href="https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin">PhoneGap Social Sharing Plugin</a> to connect the app with a user&rsquo;s social media accounts and enable instant social sharing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir="ltr">With these plugins, the application got access to the phone&rsquo;s native features. This allowed us to significantly improve the user experience and extend the app&rsquo;s functionality.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Access to contacts and friend lists for the Circle of Trust<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/how-to-build-an-online-marketplace-for-service/сircle of trust.png" alt="" width="731" height="421" /><br /><br />One problem with similar babysitting apps is that most parents aren&rsquo;t ready to trust their children to people they&rsquo;ve never met. This is why Toddy decided to add the Circle of Trust &ndash; an interesting feature that displays all the connections that parents share with their potential babysitters. Using the Circle, Toddy users can ask their friends, colleagues, and neighbours for feedback about people who might take care of their children. To implement the Circle of Trust, we had to let the app access a user&rsquo;s contacts via the <a href="https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-contacts">Cordova Contacts</a> Plugin. Additionally, we added synchronization with Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. The app uses these social accounts to find common connections between parents and babysitters and display them. The Circle of Trust helps parents ensure that their children are in good hands. <br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Payment gateway to fit the online marketplace model<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/how-to-build-an-online-marketplace-for-service/payment gateway.png" alt="" width="731" height="320" /><br /><br />The central feature of any marketplace is the ability to receive payments from customers and make payments to contractors. Choosing the right payment gateway isn&rsquo;t easy. After a deep comparison of the available payment gateway solutions, we chose the Australian service provider Pin Payments. Besides offering a marketplace solution, Pin Payments was easy to integrate with Toddy and offered low rates, which was important for the beginner business. <br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Analytics to track app performance<br /><br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/how-to-build-an-online-marketplace-for-service/снимок экрана 2017-11-20 в 15.32.51.png" alt="" width="1446" height="954" /><br /><br />Among the many different solutions for analyzing user behavior, we chose Flurry Analytics. This Yahoo service is free and can adjust to the business needs even as your business grows. Flurry allows Toddy&rsquo;s owners to analyze users&rsquo; in-app actions, which can help them plan improvements. <br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Suggestion page to gather user feedback<br />Analytics services gather only factual information about such things as the number of users who launch an app daily, the duration of their sessions, and the percentage of paying customers. But especially important is the reason why users perform these actions. We created a suggestions page to let users tell us things such as why they launch the app, why do or don&rsquo;t they do or don&rsquo;t pay for services, what features would make them trust the app more, or where they would place the &ldquo;Book&rdquo; button to make it more convenient. Real user feedback can show how the app should develop to attract more customers and therefore earn more revenue.<br /><br /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Additional Features</h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">In addition to the functionality we&rsquo;ve described, we added some additional features to make the app more user-friendly.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Registration and login via social media to make signing in quicker and more convenient<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/how-to-build-an-online-marketplace-for-service/registration and login.png" alt="" width="731" height="421" /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Postcode input to display the approximate area in which the customer lives and find babysitters who work in that area<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/how-to-build-an-online-marketplace-for-service/postcode input.png" alt="" width="731" height="421" /><br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Synchronization with Google Calendar and the phone calendar to help users keep track of appointments<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/how-to-build-an-online-marketplace-for-service/synchronization with google calendar.png" alt="" width="731" height="421" /><br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Obligatory feedback for both parents and babysitters to increase trust within the app<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/how-to-build-an-online-marketplace-for-service/suggestion page to gather real user feedback blog.png" alt="" width="731" height="421" /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir="ltr">These minor features make the application more convenient. More features will soon be developed based on analysis of user feedback from the suggestions page. Toddy&rsquo;s objective is to deliver a seamless experience to users, which is precisely what Clockwise Software is working to provide.</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">Development Time</h2>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The development team for the Toddy application consisted of two backend developers, one frontend developer, one tester, one designer, and one project manager.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Clockwise Software provided the Toddy team with a strong frontend developer and a tester. Thanks to our extensive experience working with remote teams, our cooperation with Toddy&rsquo;s project manager and backend developer went smoothly.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">We released the minimum viable product in just six months. Then the application went to alpha testing, and we started improving the existing features and adding new ones.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Before releasing the product to market, we had to implement in-app analytics and a payment system. Each of these features took around two weeks to add, so the total development time for the market-ready application was seven months.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">We&rsquo;re currently supporting the Toddy team part-time, making minor improvements to the frontend and providing software testing services.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Any idea that can potentially solve real-world problems is worth being implemented. Toddy is already making its first steps on the Australian market and seems to have great prospects.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">If you have an idea for an online marketplace that will make a real difference, don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact us for a free consultation.

And you are about to invest an impressive amount of money in development, hoping that your product will achieve success soon after the release.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Sounds like a perfect plan, but what if you realize later that your idea doesn&rsquo;t correspond with the needs of potential users? What if most of the features turn out to be redundant? What if you wasted a lot of time and money only to realize that your product isn&rsquo;t something people really need?</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">Start small</h2>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/minimum-viable-product/start small-min.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="421" /></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Actually, this happens to most &ldquo;awesome&rdquo; product ideas. Forbes claims that more than&nbsp;<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/neilpatel/2015/01/16/90-of-startups-will-fail-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-10/#5c5ceaed55e1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90% of tech startups fail</a>&nbsp;without ever realizing what they did wrong.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">To be among the remaining &nbsp;10%, you should take tiny steps to validate every assumption through user testing, and the very first steps of this long path are called <strong>wireframe, prototype and MVP</strong>.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">To explain it briefly, a <strong>wireframe</strong> is a low-fidelity black and white version of the product. It displays the pure structure of the future app or website without any distractions like colors, pictures and other content.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">A <strong>prototype</strong> is a (mostly interactive) model of your future product which you can present to your first potential investors. In this case, we are mostly talking about the 3Fs (friends, family and &ldquo;fools&rdquo;). These people are likely to be your first investors, so take this stage seriously. These investments will allow you to build the first version of your product, the so-called MVP.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="/blog/how-to-make-a-prototype" target="_blank" rel="noopener">To find out more about prototyping check out our article</a></p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">What is MVP?</h2>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>MVP, or minimum viable product</strong>, is a product with just enough features to attract the early adopters. All the other features or any improvements are developed only after analyzing the feedback from early users.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Eric Ries introduces the minimum viable product as the core component of the lean startup methodology.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">How can an MVP be useful?</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Attract investors</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A minimum viable product is a presentation of your idea for investors. If they like what you&rsquo;ve already built and what you are planning to develop, they may become your first investors. In addition to that, if your idea already attracts customers, or even paying customers - this is a strong incentive for the investor to support your business.</p>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/minimum-viable-product/investors .jpg" alt="" width="731" height="421" /></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Attract early adopters and get your first earnings</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The sooner the product is released, the sooner it will get customers. Launching an MVP is a good way to get first users before the final version of the product is ready. Moreover, it enables you to receive initial earnings. And if the product already has some users, this is a clear sign to investors because it shows there is a demand for this solution.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Receive feedback</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>One of the main benefits of the MVP is to enable you to carefully listen to your clients. They will give you real information, not just assumptions. When receiving feedback from early adopters it is important to make wise decisions based on &nbsp;this information.</p>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/minimum-viable-product/positive feedback.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="480" /></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Proof of assumption</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This is good news for you. If the customer feedback shows &nbsp;that your assumption was correct - perfect. The users like your product even in its primitive form. You now know that there is a market for your product idea, and you can develop it further, expanding it and adding new features.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Pivot on time</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Your product is not exactly what the users need? In this case the MVP experience allows you to slightly or radically change the direction of your business without significant loss. If the preferences of your target audience&rsquo;s turn out to be different to what you expected, you have an opportunity to adjust your business.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Fail early</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Most startups postpone the release, make endless improvements, and want their product to be perfect because they are afraid of failure. Even if this sounds weird, <strong>failing early is one of the best things that can happen to you</strong>. If your idea fails at the MVP stage - good for you. You managed to save months or years of hard work, as well as thousands of dollars that you must have spent on the project without any prospects. At the same time, if you really believe in your idea, you can find another solution to impress the users and the investors.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">One of the most important reasons, why you should build a minimum viable product is that it will open for you the doors to real investments. The MVP should show investors whether your product idea has a future and whether it is worth the risk.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">So, if you want to impress and attract the investors - <strong>make your MVP rock</strong>.</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">Stages of building a minimum viable product</h2>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/minimum-viable-product/steps prototype-min.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="421" /></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">When building an MVP you usually have limited time and resources. You are trying to take the shortest possible path to get your product on the market. But there are several stages that are essential before starting a minimum viable product. And you should follow all of them.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Step 1. Define the problem</h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">This is a situation when the first step can define your whole business path.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">You&rsquo;ve got an ingenious idea and immediately start the development. Later you recognize that the idea is great, but no one actually needs it.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">To reduce the risk of failure, <strong>you should start with a problem definition</strong>. If you identify an existing problem, your solution is more likely to find many users.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Step 2. Define the target audience</h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Trying to target all users is another mistake. It is impossible to get everyone to use your product. Therefore, it is much easier to satisfy a certain group of people.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Build your buyer persona and make it as specific as you can. Define age, profession, education level, earnings, family, hobbies, etc. The better you know your potential customer, the better you can meet his expectations.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Step 3. Specify the minimum feature set</h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Here comes one of the most difficult parts of building an MVP.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">When you initially thought about &nbsp;your product you probably identified &nbsp;dozens of unique features to charm your customers, but unfortunately, you&rsquo;ll have to put all these &nbsp;ideas aside until you test your assumptions concerning the problem that your idea will solve for users.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s best to start with is the minimum set of core features which will bring value to the customer. <strong>Ideally you should include only one essential feature</strong>.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>As an example</strong>: You assume, that your potential customers want to move faster. You want to build a car to solve this problem. To test your assumption you start with building a minimum viable product.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>MVP</strong>: A skateboard.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>Not MVP</strong>: Four separate wheels.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">An MVP might help you to prove your assumption, and validate your product idea. If your target audience is interested in the skateboard, then you were right, they are in need of a vehicle which helps them move faster, and they are ready to pay for it.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">If you offer the customer four wheels - this will not solve his problem. But a skateboard will.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Your MVP might be primitive, but if your idea provides a solution to an existing problem without neglecting the user experience, it will have users and the MVP will prove this assumption.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Step 4. Build MVP</h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">After defining the core features for the MVP, it&rsquo;s time to build the product.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The first rule is: <strong>Forget about perfection</strong>! At this stage, your only aim is to release the product as soon as possible to test your assumptions.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The sooner you get the product into your user&rsquo;s hands, the better. From their feedback you&rsquo;ll understand whether they are interested in this kind of a product, or whether the development is a complete waste of time and money.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">And remember, if the users like your minimum viable product with all its imperfections, the full version of the product is much more likely to charm the whole world.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Step 5. Test MVP</h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">After your minimum viable product is finished, get it into the hands of potential customers. Remember one of the first steps, the target audience definition? Find people who match your buyer persona and ask &nbsp;them to test your MVP.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">If you did everything right (defining the problem, the target audience and the minimum features set) you&rsquo;ll receive relevant feedback. This will be your clear guide as to what to do next.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>You should take the customer feedback seriously</strong>.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">It will show you whether your idea is worth investing in or not;</li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">It will prove that you defined the target audience correctly;</li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">It will give you a clear vision of how to develop your product further;</li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">It will reveal which features your product needs, and which features ot does not need.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-c6f07874-ebf0-c2d5-87fa-3ab3f7e627d7"></span>These are reliable facts, not just assumptions.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">You may be afraid of receiving negative comments about your product, but in this business there is one thing to remember: <strong>Negative feedback is better than no feedback</strong>.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Step 6. Improve your minimum viable product</h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">After receiving reliable feedback from your first users it&rsquo;s time to take advantage of this information.<span id="docs-internal-guid-c6f07874-ec39-2548-c2c2-7410840252de"></span></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">So, you know what your users like and what they don&rsquo;t like. Now you can improve the good features, remove the bad ones and add something new to see whether or not it will work.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Working in circles</h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Further work with MVP development is like &nbsp;running in circles. You build a product, get feedback, analyze it and build again to get new feedback.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The whole idea of building the minimum viable product focuses on developing the product according to the needs and preferences of real users. This helps to ensure that there will be an audience who uses, loves and is ready to pay for your product.</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">MVP mistakes and misunderstandings</h2>\r\n<div class="video-wrp"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0P7nCmln7PM" width="560" height="314" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>\r\n<p>Some startups misunderstand the lean approach. We&rsquo;d like to prevent you from making some of the most common mistakes when deciding to work on an MVP:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Too many features</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>As the name implies, an MVP should really contain the minimum functionality. You&rsquo;ll have to forget the dogma about the product perfection. Your aim is not to release a high-end product. Instead, your aim is to show the potential of your idea to users and/or investors. So don&rsquo;t waste time improving or adding extra features. Launch it now!</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Poor product quality</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Some entrepreneurs use the MVP concept as an excuse to release a low-quality product. This is a bad idea. The minimum viable product should include as little functionality as possible, but still solve the problem for its users, offering them a good UI/UX.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>At all stages of your product development, focus on delivering value</strong>!</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">An MVP release is the end station</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>No, no, no! An MVP is only the first step in understanding the needs and preferences of your clients. After this first step, prepare for a long run before you reach &nbsp;the finish line. Get ready for hard work to improve, add and discard features.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">The price of the MVP is the price for the final product</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>As we&rsquo;ve already explained, MVP is only the beginning of the long development process. Improving the product, adding new features and resolving other issues will take time and will cost &nbsp;money. You have to budget for much more expense if you want to make your product superb.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">An MVP can&rsquo;t generate income</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Actually, it can! Depending on the services you offer, you can expect to receive initial earnings even after the launch of a minimum viable product. However, &nbsp;this is not an excuse to stop because an MVP is a proof that the idea is valuable. By improving the product you can count on more loyal customers, trustworthy feedbacks and a higher income.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Hiring very expensive developers for MVP</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>As a startup at the MVP stage, you are likely to be short of money, but you will &nbsp;want to work with the best professionals and hire a well-known development company. So, most likely you&rsquo;ll run out of money sooner &nbsp;than expected. So, be realistic and answer the following questions: &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Is it crucial for you to see the developer sitting in your office? Are you ready to work with foreigners if they offer a good service based on price and quality with a professional level of English? By comparing &nbsp;different options you can choose the best and most reasonable one.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Outsourcing may enable &nbsp;you to save up to 70% on the cost of building an MVP . However it is crucial to only engage &nbsp;outsourcers that already have relevant experience in developing MVPs. This is your guarantee of high quality and achieving realistic deadlines.</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">How much does an MVP development cost?</h2>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/minimum-viable-product/math.gif" alt="Math" width="730" height="420" /></p>\r\n<p>This is probably the most frequently asked question. Of course, it is impossible to give an exact number, as this will vary significantly depending on the type of app and the complexity of the features.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">A very basic MVP application can be developed in around 300 hours. This is a couple of months for one developer, or significantly less, if you hire a team. If your product idea requires more complex features or integrations, count on around 1000 - 1400 hours to develop the minimum viable product.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The cost of the product will depend on the&nbsp;<a href="https://clutch.co/app-developers/resources/cost-build-mobile-app-survey-2015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rates of the developer you hire.</a>&nbsp;A programmer in the US will cost you around $100 per hour. Therefore, the minimum price for an MVP will be $30,000, while the maximum could exceed $100,000.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">In order not to spend your whole budget in the first few weeks, take a look at the Eastern European outsourcing market. The prices there vary between $25 and $55 per hour.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">So, take a close look at your budget and think carefully about the developers you are going to hire. Working with very expensive developers could be a bad idea, especially at this stage. You should try to achieve as much as possible while you are &nbsp;low on funds.</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">So, what is a minimum viable product all about?</h2>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Every great idea is in danger of failing. Following the MVP model can allow you to minimize these risks. The main idea of an MVP is to release the product with a set of core features as soon as possible. It is a good presentation of your product idea for the potential investors, and &nbsp;at the same time, it will bring you the first customers and very likely the first earnings.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Customer feedback at this stage is more important than you&rsquo;d think. It shows you whether you&rsquo;ve chosen the right path, and whether your assumptions concerning the product and the market are correct.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Moreover, an MVP helps to make the right decisions based on real customer feedback. Every improvement you make is connected to customer comments. You add the features they need, improve the existing features according to the target audience expectations, and make your service more customer oriented.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">An MVP is one of your first steps towards a successful business, and you should take this step wisely. Don&rsquo;t overestimate your budget and hire expensive developers from the very beginning. Consider outsourcing your product development to get more work done for the same money.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contact us</a> for a detailed estimation of your minimum viable product development.

That&rsquo;s why it is important to be ahead of the game.</p>\r\n<p class="intro"><strong>Don&rsquo;t ask what are the trends today, ask what will be the trends tomorrow.</strong></p>\r\n<p class="intro">We have gathered the most credible predictions to show you what will be the trends in web development for the next year. If you are about to build or redesign your website, be sure that you are aware of them.</p>\r\n<h2>Progressive Web Applications</h2>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/web-development-trends-in-2018/pwa.jpg" alt="Progressive Web Apps" /></p>\r\n<p>The world first heard about progressive web apps in 2015. The next year we met the pioneers of this technology, and in 2018 progressive Web Applications seem to have become the major competitor of native mobile apps.</p>\r\n<p>Progressive web apps (or PWAs) are websites that feel like native mobile apps. Thanks to service workers, they can work offline, delivering an extraordinary user experience.</p>\r\n<p>The users can save the shortcut to the website on their home screen if they use it frequently. As the most information is stored in the cache, the app loads instantly. Service workers run in the background and ensure that the latest information is cached every time the device is connected to the internet. The ability to work without any connection is one of the major advantages of progressive web apps.</p>\r\n<p>PWAs are gaining traction and becoming a true web development trend. Some world&rsquo;s leading companies prove the efficiency of this technology.</p>\r\n<p>The e-commerce website <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/2016/flipkart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flipkart experienced a 70% increase in conversions and tripled the time spent on their site</a> after the launch of the PWA version of the website. And the informational website <a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/why-does-the-washington-posts-progressive-web-app-increase-engagement-on-ios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post reported an almostfivefold increase in user engagement.</a></p>\r\n<p>PWAs have fewer features on iOS devices since the platform doesn&rsquo;t support service workers. However, Flipkart and The Washington Post have proved that the progressive web apps significantly improve user engagement and conversions on all platforms. The UX of the PWAs plays the key role.</p>\r\n<p>After such inspiring examples, the world awaits the hype around the progressive web applications in 2018. Even though the technology is quite new, its prospects look very promising.</p>\r\n<h2>Online customer support</h2>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/web-development-trends-in-2018/support.jpg" alt="Progressive Web Apps" /></p>\r\n<p>2016 was the year of chatbots. 2017 is the year of helpful chatbots. Since there are thousands of bots out now, the quality of their services will be the next web development trend.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/sc/chatbots-future-customer-service-2016-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prediction</a> is that 85% of all customer interactions will proceed without human assistance till 2020.</p>\r\n<p>A customer service chatbot becomes a must on almost every website. Whether you are selling electronics, crocheted toys or software development services, you should have a chatbot.</p>\r\n<p>The conversational interface has transformed the way businesses interact with their customers. Having a bot on the company\'s website ensures you are in contact with your client at any time, in any situation.</p>\r\n<p>The customer service chatbot gives the client a feeling of interacting with a human. The bot is smart enough to answer frequently asked questions, to redirect clients to the needed page, to help them to choose the right product and even to proceed with payments. And all this without the round-the-clock customer support department.</p>\r\n<p>In 2018 customers will prefer websites with appropriate online assistance. You can create a customer support department or get a chatbot that will guide a potential client through your website. The second option will allow you to save time and resources, and optimize the working process. So why not to join the hype around chatbots?</p>\r\n<h2>Static websites</h2>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/web-development-trends-in-2018/static.jpg" alt="Static Websites" /></p>\r\n<p>You definitely remember the concept of a static website from the early years of the World Wide Web. All the first websites on the Internet were static.</p>\r\n<p>But then the era of dynamic websites began.Websites became more functional and easier to update even for people with no technical background. At the same time, the development process became more complicated, as the extended functionality required communication with the server, so backend development got involved. Modern CMSs are the actual dynamic websites</p>\r\n<p>Nowadays, the web is returning to its roots. Static websites are becoming the web development trend of 2018 again. But they have been improved by static site generators which allow combining the advantages of a static website and a CMS. The most popular of them, for example, <a href="https://hexo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hexo</a>, <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitBook</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gatsby</a> are written in JavaScript. There is also a huge variety of static site generators written in other programming languages. You can find out more and compare different solutions on the <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StaticGen</a> website.</p>\r\n<p>There are several reasons why static websites are back. They are faster, safer and cheaper. And they can satisfy the needs of different types of businesses. So, the prediction is obvious: static websites will experience a new reincarnation in 2018.</p>\r\n<h2>Single-page websites</h2>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/web-development-trends-in-2018/spa.gif" alt="Single-page websites" /></p>\r\n<p>Another web development trend for simplicity is single-page websites. This solution allows putting all the content onto one long scrollable page, removing any clutter.</p>\r\n<p>One-page websites have a <a href="https://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/design/8-reasons-why-pageless-design-is-the-future-of-the-web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bunch of advantages</a>. They don&rsquo;t challenge the visitor with complex navigation, multi-level menu, and tons of text. The essential information is all on one page. The user only has to scroll to it.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, the use-cases of single-pagers are limited. This type of website will not suit e-commerce projects and blogs. At the same time, businesses can significantly benefit, presenting their services in a simplified and more engaging manner.</p>\r\n<p>When visiting your one-page website the user consumes the information consecutivelyand doesn&rsquo;t jump over the pages in the random order. You have certain control over the way he learns more about your company. Such websites are great for mobile use.</p>\r\n<p>This type of website is definitely more user-friendly. At the same time, it allows to reduce the costs of the website: design is cheaper, development is cheaper, hosting is cheaper.</p>\r\n<p>The single-pagers usually attract with extraordinary design, and powerful accents which bring an impressive increase in conversion. That&rsquo;s why single page apps will gain traction in 2018.</p>\r\n<h2>Push notifications for websites</h2>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/web-development-trends-in-2018/notifications.gif" alt="Push notifications for websites" /></p>\r\n<p>Mobile apps notifications turned out to be a highly efficient means of user re-engagement. And recently this idea has been implemented for websites and is becoming new web development trend.</p>\r\n<p>The workflow looks quite simple: the user visits a website and is offered to enable push notifications. The user will then be notified of any changes on the website (like a new blog post or a private message), even after he has closed the tab with that website.</p>\r\n<p>The major <a href="https://kickofflabs.com/blog/heres-need-know-website-push-notifications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benefit of such a technology</a> is obvious - you can keep the user engaged without big efforts.</p>\r\n<p>In some cases, push notifications can be a cheaper alternative toa mobile app. They deliver new information instantly and redirect the user to the website to find out more.</p>\r\n<p>Push notifications beat emails, SMS and social media in providing up-to-date information. They are quick, come on time, and don&rsquo;t require any complicated actions. They are just user-friendly.</p>\r\n<p>Since push-notifications are just making the first steps in user engagement, you have a chance to become the pioneer of this technology in 2018.</p>\r\n<h2>Flash to HTML</h2>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/web-development-trends-in-2018/flash-to-html.jpg" alt="Flash to HTML" /></p>\r\n<p>In 2010 Steve Jobs published his <a href="https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thoughts on Flash</a> and its future. It became clear that this technology won&rsquo;t last long. Jobs&rsquo; statement about the death of Flash is quite popular for around two years now when YouTube defaulted to HTML5 players.</p>\r\n<p>The major weakness of this technology is the incompatibility with mobile devices. An enormous amount of traffic is lost just because of the outdated technology.</p>\r\n<p>If you still use Flash on your website, 2017 is the final call for you to change this. The best alternative is the well-known HTML5.</p>\r\n<p>HTML5-based videos and games will reach a wider audience. And the general tendency is: HTML5 is becoming the universal format for all types of digital content.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s no use being sentimental about your old Flash website. Trust us, the HTML5 one will be much cooler and correspond with the latest web development trends.</p>\r\n<h2>Motion UI</h2>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/web-development-trends-in-2018/motion-ui.png" alt="Motion UI" /></p>\r\n<p>Simplicity is the trend in recent years. This is also true for web design. Users are already tired of crazy GIFs and flashing ads, that&rsquo;s why websites with moderate design get more appreciation.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, sophisticated motion UI is becoming more popular. Animations allow to add more style and enable you to distinguish your website from the thousands of others with the static UI.</p>\r\n<p>There are several ways to add some life to your minimalistic website. Consider page header transitions, nice hovers, animated charts, background animations and modular scrolling. These and many otherelements may make your web presence much more enjoyable for users. The true artwork!</p>\r\n<h2>JavaScript - Angular 2 and Angular 4</h2>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/web-development-trends-in-2018/angular.jpg" alt="AngularJS" /></p>\r\n<p>JavaScript is the number one programming language for web applications. With dozens of JS-related technologies already existing and still in development, it will even strengthen its positions. The highly anticipated release of the last years Angular 2 becomes highly appreciated in modern web development.</p>\r\n<p>We met Angular 2 in 2016. It is a complete rewrite of the AngularJS framework. The main advantages are improved modularity, app architecture scalability, <a href="https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improved dependencies injections</a>, etc.</p>\r\n<p>What to expect from Angular 2? Compared to its predecessor, it is faster and simpler in structure. Moreover, it follows the mobile-first approach, which is highly important in 2018. Many solutions are ready to use right out ofthe box, which reduces the development time.</p>\r\n<p>Angular 2 recommends the use of TypeScript. This combination is by now the most productive way to develop medium and large web applications compatible with any modern web browser or mobile platform.</p>\r\n<p>Angular 4 appeared in March 2017. This is not a complete rewrite of the second version, so they are quite similar. Angular 4 is faster and consumes less space, reducing the size of the generated code to around 60%. The animation package has been removed fromthe core and put into a separate package, which is an advantage for those who don&rsquo;t use animation in their projects.</p>\r\n<p>According to the <a href="http://angularjs.blogspot.com/2016/10/versioning-and-releasing-angular.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roadmap</a>, it is planned to release patch versions weekly with minorreleases following every several months. The next major release is planned for September 2017 - we are expecting the new Angular 5.0.0. We can predict that the changes will also influence the web development trends for the nearest future. So, don&rsquo;t forget to follow the <a href="https://blog.angular.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angular Blog</a> to stay tuned for the freshest updates. Or subscribe to our blog - we won&rsquo;t miss a chance to write about this major update of one of our favourite frontend frameworks.</p>\r\n<h2>PHP 7.x - Laravel 5.x</h2>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/web-development-trends-in-2018/laravel.jpg" alt="Laravel" /></p>\r\n<p>PHP remains the popular choice for website backend development. This programming language has improved its positions even further after the release of version 7.x. The latest update of the PHP framework Laravel 5.x is a recognized web development trend in 2018.</p>\r\n<p>Laravel is the most popular open-source PHP web framework. All the benefits of it can be fully experienced on dynamic websites with complicated backend.</p>\r\n<p>Laravel offers ready solutions for complex tasks. The variety of existing packages makes the development process faster and more reliable. Regular updates ensure that the framework complies with the current needs of the website owners and the requirements of the time.</p>\r\n<p>The current stable version is Laravel 5.5, released in July 2017. Major updates occur every fewmonths.</p>\r\n<p>This open-source framework has a large developer community, so you will never have to deal with the problems in your web app on your own.</p>\r\n<p>If you want to find out more about Laravel along with other backend frameworks, don&rsquo;t miss our article.</p>\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p>Nowadays having a website is more important for the company than having an office.</p>\r\n<p>Being ahead of web development trends means attractingnew customers, satisfying existing customers and encouraging older customers to return.</p>\r\n<p>Are you just about to create or redesign your website?

How to build a successful online marketplace?",pageTags:["Business"],pageContent:'<p dir="ltr">Have you ever felt that you own &nbsp;too much stuff? A second car you barely drive, a set of garden tools you use only once a year, a room on the upper floor you enter just to wipe the dust. If you&rsquo;ve already thought about selling or renting your unused property - you are a candidate for the sharing economy. If your idea was to create a project to enable the quick exchange of goods or services - congratulations! You can call yourself an entrepreneur.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The sharing economy has become a buzzword in just few years. Quite obviously, it means sharing the property you own, but temporarily don&rsquo;t use, with people who may be in need of it.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Exchanging goods and services isn&rsquo;t a new approach, but the digital evolution of the recent years has presented an elegant solution to make the sharing economy massive and international - online marketplaces - and the hype began.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><em>In 2007 two young men moved to San Francisco with one aim - to become a part of a rapidly developing tech industry. They could hardly pay the rent and started to look for ideas how to earn money quickly. At that time the Industry Design Conference took place in SF. The men took a moment and decided to offer airbeds and breakfast to the participants who had not managed &nbsp;to book a hotel. The first three customers came very quickly and proved that sharing free space in a flat or house may be a good way to earn extra money.</em></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">These two young men were Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, and their idea turned into one of the most successful startups of our time - Airbnb.</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">Online marketplaces bringing the sharing economy to a new level<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/how-to-build-an-online-marketplace/online market place.jpg" alt="" width="732" height="601" /></h2>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Besides being one of the pioneers of sharing economy, Airbnb is a classic example of an online marketplace. What is it? What is the difference between a marketplace and an online shop?</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">An online marketplace is a website or app where third party providers can submit their goods and services, presenting them directly to potential customers. The key feature of a marketplace is the peer-to-peer approach. This means that everyone (not necessary a company) can be a distributor, as well as a buyer.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">A marketplace is often confused with an online shop, where the manufacturer or distributor sells only his goods or services.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">With an online marketplace, everyone has the opportunity to offer their property, goods or services to a wide audience without any limits. Potential clients, on the contrary, can choose from the variety of offers, and aren&rsquo;t limited in their choice.</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">How to build an online marketplace? What is the potential of your idea?</h2>\r\n<p dir="ltr">One of the nice things about the sharing economy is the fact that literally anyone can enter the market with a marketplace idea, and become successful.<br /><br />Take for example Airbnb; it started with solving a problem the founders themselves had, and this grew into a company which now operates in 99% of countries worldwide. So, having an idea is important, and here is how you can discover the potential of your idea.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Is there the pain point you are going to solve with your app?</h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia were focusing on solving their own problem, and not on doing business. But suddenly it turned out that their pain point resonated with the problems of millions of people all around the globe; those who had unused spaces in their flats and houses, and &nbsp;others who were looking for convenient and cheap accommodation during their trips.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The key to the success of their idea was simple - discovering the pain points of both sides (the service providers and the customers) and offering the best solution possible.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">But unfortunately, not every idea can become a unicorn worth billions of dollars. <a href="http://upfrontanalytics.com/does-silicon-valley-respect-market-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">42% of startups fail</a> due to lack of market need. In other words, there may be great ideas, but no one actually needs them.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">So, to make sure the idea you are going to turn into a real product will have users - test it. Prepare a prototype of the product, get it into the hands of your potential users and listen carefully to what they say.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">How to define your target audience?</h3>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/how-to-build-an-online-marketplace/target audience latest.jpg" alt="" width="784" height="554" /></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Based on market research, you have to define your buyer personas. These are the semi-fictional characters that have the features of your ideal customer.</p>\r\n<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-9c43535a-38d0-f763-0e4e-3afcc4eb8183">To describe your potential customer as precisely as possible, follow these points:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Age</li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Location</li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Occupation</li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Education level</li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Yearly income</li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Possible pain points</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Online marketplaces are different because they target two completely different audiences at the same time: the service providers and the consumers, and, you should build buyer personas for both of them.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Depending on the type of marketplace you are going to build, add more questions to better understand the expectations of your potential customer.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">For example, let&rsquo;s say you are going to build a marketplace for dog walkers. In this case, the potential service provider, or the pet sitter, is a student without a permanent income, lives alone in a big city, had a dog when he lived with his parents and therefore loves dogs, is interested in a part-time job, and has at least 5 hours per week to walk other dogs.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The potential client of the dog walker might be a business lady aged 35 - 45 with a certain income, who lives alone in a big city, has two dogs, has a non-flexible working schedule, etc.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The more exact the buyer personas are, the better you can target potential customers with the right solution and the right advertising.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Is there a market for the idea?</h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The market volume is also important. By analyzing the market you can decide which part of it you will target. The market of ride-sharing, for example, is huge. All over the world people are driving their cars and would be glad to share the cost of fuel with a passenger. On the other hand, there are plenty of people, who would prefer to share a ride with someone instead of taking a bus or a train.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">However, the market for a ride-sharing service isn&rsquo;t the whole world. Firstly, there are regions with low standards of living (some countries in Asia, Africa or South America). Most people there don&rsquo;t own cars, and most of them never leave their home town. There is no actual problem; therefore there is no need for a solution. Is it worth launching a ride-sharing service in these countries? Obviously, no.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Secondly, there are countries with specific traditions, values, and laws. The law in Saudi Arabia, for example, didn&rsquo;t &nbsp;allow women to drive cars <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/saudi-arabia-women-drive-170926190857109.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">until recently</a>, and using public transport wasn&rsquo;t an alternative as well. We don&rsquo;t expect the situation to change dramatically in the nearest time, which means, women will still prefer using private cars with a driver. Would it be a good idea for a ridesharing service to expand to a country with strict Islamic traditions, like Saudi Arabia? Yes, it would, but it requires a specific approach.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Not every successful marketplace needs to start with a genius idea. Sometimes an existing idea will be successful, but just adapted to the needs of a particular market. Some online marketplace businesses may be afraid of entering specific markets, such as Arabic countries, because of big differences in lifestyle and laws. But if you are a resident of such a country and understand the market well, this could be a great opportunity. You can adapt the idea to the reality of the target audience and make it even more successful than the original one!</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Who are the competitors?</h3>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/how-to-build-an-online-marketplace/competitors.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="421" /></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">In a perfect world you&rsquo;d love to have your idea in a big blue ocean without any competitors. But the reality is different. Almost everything you can think of has already been invented. That&rsquo;s why it is highly important to know your competition. This gives you a chance to beat them.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">What advantages do your competitors have? What are their drawbacks? Can you offer your clients something better with your product? Can you predict how your competitors can improve their products in the near future? Will the competition increase in the near future?</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">How can you deliver more value than the competitor? Analyzing the competition allows you to be one step forward.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">What are the possible monetization models?<br /><br /></h3>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr"><img src="/img/blog/how-to-build-an-online-marketplace/monetization latest.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="421" /></h3>\r\n<p>Any project has to earn money to attract investors and become internationally successful. The marketplace is no exception. There are several ways of monetizing your online marketplace:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Commission<br />The marketplace charges a percentage or a fixed fee for every successful transaction on the website;<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Subscription <br />The users pay a monthly/yearly fee to use the marketplace;<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Listing fee<br />The seller has to pay for every listing he/she adds to the marketplace;<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Freemium<br />Most features on the marketplace are free, the premium ones are paid;<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Advertising<br />The more users the marketplace has, the more it can earn for showing &nbsp;advertisements. With this model, users usually don&rsquo;t have to pay for using the service, the ads generate revenue for the service.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7b1326e5-38d5-e285-463e-4da66afebb64"><br />Couchsurfing, for example, makes money by displaying ads to its multimillion community. Airbnb, on the contrary, doesn&rsquo;t have ads on its website. Its revenue comes from the commission the service receives from every successful transaction.</span></p>\r\n<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7b1326e5-38d5-e285-463e-4da66afebb64">When choosing the monetization model, you should take into account the legal aspects of the particular market. The escrow payment, for example, is a popular solution for online marketplaces. This allows the marketplace itself to be a middleman that holds the money for its users.</span></p>\r\n<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7b1326e5-38d5-e285-463e-4da66afebb64">Here is how escrow payments work: the marketplace charges the money from the consumer for the products or services ordered. The money remains in the marketplace account until the provider has fulfilled their obligations; only then is the provider paid. The marketplace, in this case, is the third party, that regulates and guarantees the financial relationship between providers and consumers.</span></p>\r\n<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7b1326e5-38d5-e285-463e-4da66afebb64">In the USA, for example, escrow payments are regulated on a state level. This means that the business has to get a state license to deliver such a service to their customers. Some countries do not allow escrow payments at all.</span></p>\r\n<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7b1326e5-38d5-e285-463e-4da66afebb64">It&rsquo;s important to choose a monetization model that will correspond with the philosophy of the product, however, the legal regulations are a highly important aspect to consider.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">How to start online marketplace development?</h2>\r\n<p dir="ltr">So, your idea seems to have real potential. It solves existing problems, there is a market for the idea, and even the possibility of earning money. But don&rsquo;t hurry to approach investors. There are still some things to do before that.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Create a prototype and test the idea<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/how-to-build-an-online-marketplace/how to make a prototype.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="421" /></h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">First of all, you need to get the idea out of your head and make it visual. This can be done with a prototype, which is a sketch, a simplified model of what you are going to build.<br /><br />You can start with a simple pen-and-paper prototype or build an interactive HTML prototype - this depends on your skills and the fidelity you are aiming for.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Here&rsquo;s a small tip: the prototype will be helpful when you start the development of your product. So, it sometimes makes sense to hire a professional to create a high-quality product. If you decided to start prototyping by yourself - <a title="How to make a prototype" href="/blog/how-to-make-a-prototype" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out our article on this topic</a>. The insights will be really helpful.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The prototype is the best way to present the idea to help convince a co-founder or first employees, generate interest from first users, and to attract early investments.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Prepare the project documentation</h3>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/how-to-build-an-online-marketplace/documantation.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="421" /></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Though it seems to be a monotonous task, writing detailed project documentation will save you plenty of time and money in the development process. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you hire in-house developers or a dedicated team - the documentation will be the clear roadmap for them.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">It helps to ensure that everyone correctly understands the goal and functionality of the product.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Develop the MVP</h3>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/how-to-build-an-online-marketplace/mvp.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="421" /></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">After preparing the prototype and the project documentation, you are now ready to start the development of the product, the minimum viable product, to be exact.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The minimum viable product, or the MVP, is the product with just enough features to attract early users. The main idea of the MVP is to get the product into the hands of the target audience as soon as possible. After releasing the minimum viable product, you will fully rely on user feedback, and must be ready to make steady improvements.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Sometimes the minimum viable product reveals the sad truth - the assumptions you made during the market analysis are false, and the idea wasn&rsquo;t as brilliant as it first seemed. You now have a chance to change the direction slightly and adjust the idea to meet the real needs of the market - or &nbsp;give up, in which case, failing early means failing cheaply.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Just take a look at how Airbnb started their web <a href="http://prntscr.com/ez3y50" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presence. </a></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">This simple website had one aim - to prove the assumption that the idea would attract people&rsquo;s attention. Realizing the potential of such a service, the investors were unstoppable. In its 8-year history, Airbnb has raised $4,4 billion and is listed as one of the most successful startups of our time.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Of course, their website now looks much prettier and attracts millions of users. But the ugly minimum viable version of it did just what it needed to do - it proved the potential.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The initial idea of the MVP is to launch a product with just enough functionality to attract early adopters. A minimum viable product is not about offering extensive features and earning money. It&rsquo;s about validating the idea, finding potential users, receiving feedback on your product, and constantly improving it.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Besides validating your assumptions concerning your marketplace idea, the minimum viable product will help you attract the first users and even the first payments. Having an MVP that is already showing some results also makes you attractive to initial &nbsp;investors.<br /><br />You will find the detailed information concerning <a title="MVP" href="/blog/minimum-viable-product" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MVP development in our article</a>.</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">Looking for some inspiration?</h2>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The sharing economy seems to be a good branch to start.

It influences almost everything: the speed, and therefore cost of development, the compatibility with other technologies, the speed and performance of the app itself, and so on.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The variety of technologies is enormous. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve decided to prepare a series of articles to compare the most popular technologies for different purposes.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">We are starting with frontend frameworks since they are responsible for what users see in their browser.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Attention! This article is written based on our own experience using these JavaScript frameworks for various web development projects. Some subjective conclusions may be included, but they are all supported with real-life examples. So, let&rsquo;s dive in!</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">A frontend framework - why would you need one?<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/angular-vs-react-vs-vue/frontend 731 : 421.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="421" /></h2>\r\n<p dir="ltr">A little bit of theory first. In web development, we always differentiate between frontend and backend.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The frontend is the part of the website that the user sees in his browser. The backend, accordingly, is the part that stays behind the scenes and is usually responsible for the business logic of the web app.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">A frontend consists of three very important elements:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">HTML<br />Builds the structure of the web page;</li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">CSS<br />Formats the appearance of the structure elements;</li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">JavaScript&nbsp;<br />A programming language that describes the functionality and is responsible for all the dynamic elements on the web page.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Technically, all the three elements of a frontend are just lines of code that are then rendered by the browser to display a beautiful web page. Developers spend many hours writing code to make your website look great. But there are helpers that can reduce the amount of code required and optimize the development process in general. The result is a reduction in development time and cost to bring the product to the market. These helpers are called frameworks.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">According to Wikipedia, a &ldquo;software framework is a universal, reusable software environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform to facilitate the development of software applications, products, and solutions. Software frameworks may include support programs, compilers, code libraries, tool sets, and application programming interfaces (APIs) that bring together all the different components to enable development of a project or system.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">A software framework (be it frontend or backend) includes standardized pre-written code, which makes the development of certain functionality easier and faster.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Selecting a frontend framework isn&rsquo;t easy. There are so many things to consider, with many advantages and disadvantages to compare, and so many issues to discuss! To make your decision, we have prepared a detailed comparison of three major JavaScript frameworks. After reading this article, your choice will certainly be easier!</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">JavaScript frontend frameworks</h2>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Why JavaScript? This is one of the <a href="http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most popular</a> programming languages worldwide and the most widespread technology for building web interfaces.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Generally, it is possible to write the frontend code in any programming language, however, this code should be converted into JavaScript as the browsers can only execute JS. Therefore, JavaScript is the optimal choice for frontend development.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">There are many JavaScript frameworks which make the client-side development easier and faster. We are going to describe three of the most popular and best-performing frameworks, which we often use in our projects. Here we go!</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">Angular 2+</h2>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/angular-vs-react-vs-vue/angular-731x421.png" alt="" width="731" height="421" /></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The history of Angular began in 2010 when the AngularJS framework was released by Google. In 2016 Angular 2 appeared, which was a complete rewrite of Angular JS. Together with Angular 4 and 5 released in 2017, these framework versions have become the main web development trends of the current year. And here are the reasons.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Advantages of Angular framework</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">MVC framework<br />Angular is a traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework. Due to this structure, the application is divided into three interconnected components. This enables developers to write well-structured code, which is even more beneficial for complex projects.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Angular templates<br />\r\n<pre class="language-markup"><code>&lt;form\r\n  [formGroup]="form"\r\n  #loginForm="ngForm"\r\n  (submit)="login(loginForm)"&gt;\r\n    &lt;ion-list&gt;\r\n        &lt;ion-item&gt;\r\n            &lt;ion-label&gt;\r\n                Email\r\n            &lt;/ion-label&gt;\r\n            &lt;ion-input\r\n                type="text"\r\n                required\r\n                formControlName="email"\r\n                placeholder="email@adress.com"&gt;\r\n            &lt;/ion-input&gt;\r\n        &lt;/ion-item&gt;\r\n        &lt;ion-item&gt;\r\n            &lt;ion-label&gt;\r\n                Password\r\n            &lt;/ion-label&gt;\r\n            &lt;ion-input\r\n                type="password"\r\n                required\r\n                formControlName="password"\r\n                placeholder="Password"&gt;\r\n            &lt;/ion-input&gt;\r\n        &lt;/ion-item&gt;\r\n    &lt;/ion-list&gt;\r\n    &lt;button ion-button type="submit" class="email-login"&gt;\r\n        Log In\r\n    &lt;/button&gt;\r\n    &lt;button\r\n        ion-button\r\n        type="button"\r\n        class="login-forgot"\r\n        (click)="resetPassword(loginForm)"&gt;\r\n            Forgot Password?\r\n    &lt;/button&gt;\r\n&lt;/form&gt;​</code></pre>\r\n<br />The templates are readable because they use mostly standard HTML tags. <br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Simple implementation of two-way data binding<br />Two-way data binding means that any changes to the model affect the view, and vice versa when the view changes, the model is immediately changed as well. Angular allows simple two-way data binding, which is beneficial for simple applications. More complex apps will work faster with one-way data binding, which works only in one direction (view-to-model or model-to-view), depending on the needs of the software. This enables resources to be saved. <br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Big community<br />Angular has a big community, which has been &nbsp;forming since the release of AngularJS and became even stronger when version 2 was released. The framework has had <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 1 million downloads</a> in the last month on npm and <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 26 thousands stars</a> on Github. This popularity means the availability of various solutions that are compatible with different versions of Angular, as well as the possibility of receiving advice from experienced developers and users without needing to contact the official support.<br /><br /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Disadvantages of Angular</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Doesn&rsquo;t use shadow DOM as a default<br />Shadow DOM addresses the problem of unique names of page elements or IDs, which can give developers serious problems, especially when it comes to complex projects. A developer can change the CSS style in one file, and other files are also affected by the same change. Shadow DOM allows the browser to include a subtree of DOM elements into the rendering of a document, but not into the main document DOM. Shadow DOM encapsulates the styles, scripts, and content inside a custom element, so that they don&rsquo;t interfere with other content in the app.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">In the case of Angular 2+ shadow DOM is enabled in browsers that support it natively. Otherwise, the shadow DOM encapsulation is emulated. <br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Doesn&rsquo;t use virtual DOM at all<br />A virtual DOM is a simplified copy of the DOM. The virtual DOM allows changing any element quickly, without the need to render the whole DOM. This approach is the trend among modern web development frameworks, but, unfortunately, it isn&rsquo;t supported by any Angular version yet. Instead, Angular 2 uses unidirectional data flow to detect changes to the model and updates only the parts of the DOM that are affected by changes to the model.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Usage of TypeScript<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/angular-vs-react-vs-vue/typescript.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="337" /><br /><br />Being a JS framework, Angular supports the usage of pure JavaScript. But this framework was created to be used with TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft. TypeScript allows releasing the true power of Angular, but there is one disadvantage - you will have to spend some time learning the new syntax. <br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Lower render speed<br />The limited usage of shadow DOM and lack of virtual DOM result in lower performance. The view render/re-render speed is slower compared to the performance shown by other JavaScript frameworks on our chart. <br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Heavyweight code<br />Angular is a monolithic framework with heavyweight code, which needs to be downloaded from the server. As a result, the website speed and performance decrease. Fortunately, these problems can be solved with tree-shaking, a technique that allows to eliminate unused code in an app. Webpack 2 is a perfect environment for tree-shaking. And this is <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2016/tree-shaking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how it works</a>: Webpack scans the code, putting all the modules in a single file, at the same time it removes all the &ldquo;export&rdquo; from code that isn&rsquo;t being imported. After that, you have to run a minification process.

It is supported by Facebook and Instagram, and has become a core technology in the endless feed of these two applications. As a JS library, React has quite a limited sphere of usage, but when bundled with other libraries it becomes a powerful solution, which nowadays is one of the main competitors of Angular. And this is why:</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Advantages of React</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Component model<br />React doesn&rsquo;t use any templates. The component logic is written in JavaScript, which gives more flexibility, enables rich data to easily pass through your app, and keep state out of the DOM. Though this approach is used in all the compared frontend frameworks, React was the first one to introduce a component model.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Virtual DOM<br />As already explained, a virtual DOM enables creating a simplified copy of the DOM. All the changes that need to be implemented are made in the virtual DOM. Later on, two DOMs are compared and when the differences are identified, the real DOM will re-render only the changed part. This is much faster and more efficient than working directly with the DOM. <br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">One-way data binding<br />\r\n<pre class="language-javascript"><code>class PostsIndex extends Component {\r\n  ...\r\n  renderPosts () {\r\n    return this.props.posts.map(post =&gt; {\r\n      return (\r\n        &lt;li\r\n          onClick={() =&gt; {this.onPostClick(post.id)}}\r\n          className="list-group-item"\r\n          key={post.id}&gt;\r\n            {post.title}\r\n        &lt;/li&gt;\r\n      );\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n  render () {\r\n\treturn {this.renderPosts()}\r\n  }\r\n}​</code></pre>\r\n<br />Two-way data binding was an advantage for Angular, and the one-way data binding of React may be an advantage as well. This approach makes the view react to any changes made to the model, but the view itself cannot affect the model. As a result, the data only flows in one direction, which reduces the possibility of any side effects. <br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Native mobile development framework<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/angular-vs-react-vs-vue/react native blog.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="421" /><br /><br />React Native is an affiliate of React.js, a framework created to develop native mobile apps using JavaScript. With its help, applications include native building blocks and look exactly the same as apps built with Objective-C or Java. The big advantage is that you only need one developer to build the native application for two platforms, as only a knowledge of JavaScript is needed. When compared to hybrid mobile apps built with Angular, React Native apps show much higher performance and are almost as powerful as native apps.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Big community<br />Being supported by the world&rsquo;s two major social media companies, React has millions of users across the globe. The strong community means access to quick help from experienced developers. On <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github React</a> has gathered over 73 thousand stars, and the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usage statistics on npm</a>&nbsp;shows that the framework was downloaded more than 4,766 million in the last month. A very impressive score! &nbsp;<br /><br /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-c53396c5-d935-9457-485f-d4c80f7630c8">Disadvantages of React</span></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Need to use third-party technologies<br />As already mentioned, React is a JavaScript library, not a framework. As a result, its possibilities are limited. To extend the functionality, it is necessary to use third-party modules and libraries. Reading the documentation and learning how to use these technologies may take some time.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Using JSX<br />React recommends using <a href="https://jsx.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JSX</a> instead of regular JavaScript and HTML. Actually, this is JavaScript, but extended with XML syntax. The creators claim that JSX is faster, safer and easier than JS. So, to get the most from React you will need to learn this modification of JavaScript.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Complex app structure<br />React doesn&rsquo;t have any predefined structure. This means that structuring the app is fully the responsibility of the developer, and depends a lot on his knowledge and experience.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Steep learning curve<br />React isn&rsquo;t the easiest technology to learn. Besides React itself, you will need to get to know several other libraries and modules as well.<br /><br /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">When to use React?</h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">React is pretty universal, which means you can build nearly anything with it. However, there are some cases, where React is an absolute must. For these apps it is currently the best solution available on the market.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Dynamic application<br />Building an app that needs to re-render quickly? React is a good choice due to the ability to quickly reflect the data changes in the view. <br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Single page apps<br />Since React can display content changes without reloading the current page, it is a great solution for single page apps.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Native mobile apps<br />React Native enables building mobile apps that are indistinguishable from native apps built with Java or Objective-C.<br /><br /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">React in action</h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">React was developed and supported by Facebook and Instagram, and these two social media are a classic example of React usage.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Not surprisingly, Facebook uses its own technology in its products. &nbsp;React Native, for example, is the key technology around the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/ads-manager-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ads Manager app</a> - the mobile website and app that allows clients to manage their Facebook ads on the go. The developers claim that it is the first cross-platform React Native app, and they have even posted a <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/1189117404435352/react-native-for-android-how-we-built-the-first-cross-platform-react-native-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">story about how it was created</a>.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram<br /><br /></a>The web version of Instagram is also built entirely with React. The JavaScript library provides content updates without the need to reload the page, which is exactly how the Instagram feed works. The Instagram mobile app uses React Native. And here is the <a href="https://engineering.instagram.com/react-native-at-instagram-dd828a9a90c7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article where Instagram developers share the story of migrating to React Native</a>.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Here at Clockwise Software we also have experience in building web applications with React.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="/segment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Segment AI</a><a href="/segment"><br /><br /></a>For this web application which has elements of data science, we have chosen a combination of Laravel PHP for backend, and React JS as a central frontend technology. The tool Mix enabled quick installation of all the necessary plugins to enable the compatibility of these web development frameworks. As a result, we&rsquo;ve built a robust and powerful application that includes the data science module written in Python.</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">Vue.js<br /><img src="/img/blog/angular-vs-react-vs-vue/vuejs.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="421" /></h2>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Vue.js is a progressive framework for UI building. This alternative to Angular and React is now gaining popularity. It is extremely popular in China, and is now spreading to the west, which is to be expected.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Advantages of Vue.js</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">MVC framework<br />Just like Angular, Vue is an MVC (or Model-View-Controller) framework. The advantage of this is obvious - the ability to write well-structured code, which is extremely important when working on complex applications. <br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Lightweight solution<br />One of the significant advantages of Vue is the small size of the framework as it doesn&rsquo;t include many features right &ldquo;out the box&rdquo;, but the functionality is easily extended with a variety of third-party solutions. It is often compared to Angular, which is a monolithic framework with a bunch of built-in features, which are unlikely to be used in your app at all. Of course, tree-shaking allows eliminating the unused code, but the size of the framework remains higher <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/comparison.html#Size-and-Performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared to what Vue offers</a>. A full-featured Vue 2 project with Vuex + vue-router weighs ~30kb gzipped. At the same time, an out-of-the-box, AOT-compiled application generated by angular-cli has the size of ~130kb gzipped. A compact size and the ability to include third-party modules to extend the functionality make Vue.js a wiser choice for those who care about reducing the size, and therefore improving the speed of the web app. <br /><br /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Declarative templates<br />\r\n<pre class="language-markup"><code>&lt;form\r\n  ref="form"\r\n  class="form"\r\n  action="/action"\r\n  method="POST"&gt;\r\n    &lt;label\r\n      v-for="field in info.fields"\r\n      v-bind:class="{\'error\': getError(field)}"\r\n      class="field-wrp"&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class="field-label"&gt;\r\n          {{field.name}}\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class="input-wrp"&gt;\r\n          &lt;input\r\n            v-if="field.type === \'text\' || field.type === \'email\'"\r\n            :type="field.type"\r\n            :name="field.name"/&gt;\r\n          &lt;textarea\r\n            v-if="field.type === \'textarea\'"\r\n            v-bind:class="{\'error\': getError(field)}"\r\n            :name="field.name"\r\n            rows="3"&gt;\r\n          &lt;/textarea&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/label&gt;\r\n    &lt;div\r\n      class="submit"\r\n      @click="submit"&gt;\r\n        &lt;span class="submit-title"&gt;\r\n          {{info.submitTitle}}\r\n        &lt;/span&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/form&gt;​</code></pre>\r\n<br />The templates in Vue.js are written in HTML, which makes them readable without the knowledge of other programming languages.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Virtual DOM<br />Due to lighter-weight virtual DOM implementation, apps built with Vue.js have the highest performance in comparison to other frontend frameworks. <br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Two-way data binding<br />Vue.js automatically syncs the whole model with the DOM.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Supported by Laravel &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo;<br />Laravel is one of the best PHP backend frameworks. The support of Vue allows building web apps using two of the most progressive technologies without any additional installations. <br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Pure JavaScript<br />Vue.js uses pure JavaScript, so there&rsquo;s no need for the developers or testers to learn any other programming language or its variation.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Low learning curve<br />Compared to Angular and React, Vue.js is the easiest frontend technology to learn and start working with. In addition to this, you can start adding Vue.js to your project step by step.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Rising popularity<br />With about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">658,000 downloads per month</a>, Vue.js is showing great results. Over 63 thousand Github stars prove the rising popularity, and reflects the views of the community as well. Vue.js is now being used all over the world. This means that there will be more and more solutions compatible with this JS framework.<br /><br /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Disadvantages of Vue.js</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Small community<br />Vue is less popular when compared to Angular and React, both of which have an impressive number of users. However, you can still count on support from other community members.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Fewer libraries for Vue.js<br />Since there are fewer users of the framework, they share fewer solutions to extend the framework functionality.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Chinese roots<br />This framework was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/youyuxi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evan You</a> a former Angular developer. He knew exactly the weak points of Angular and started to work on an alternative, while keeping all its advantages. The new framework quickly became extremely popular in his native country China. As a result, documentation for some of the third-party libraries may be available only in Chinese. <br /><br /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">When to use Vue.js?</h3>\r\n<p>Vue can be used for many different types of applications. Due to its compatibility with other JavaScript libraries and ability to add more complex logic to the existing apps, it can provide a perfect solution for nearly any type of project. But you should consider Vue.js as a primary option for the following requirements:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Dynamic high-performance applications<br />Similar to React, Vue.js is a good choice for dynamic applications, however thanks to virtual DOM it offers higher performance, which is beneficial for complex apps.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Single page apps<br />Vue.js allows changing the content quickly without reloading the page, which makes this framework perfect for SPAs.<br /><br /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Vue.js in action</h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Even though Vue is a relatively new technology, it is already being used in several large-scale projects mostly in China.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The websites of Alibaba, Xiaomi, Baidu, and Tencent all use Vue.js as a central frontend technology.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Clockwise Software website</a> was built using Vue.js together with Nuxt.js - a framework for creating Universal Vue.js Applications. VueJS has allowed us to create simple and well-structured components and pages and Nuxt.js enables us to perform static generation of website pages. The statically generated pages are good for SEO and also extremely fast because the server does not need to perform rendering.</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The family of JavaScript frameworks is huge. They are built to solve different tasks, their functionality can be extended by using various third party solutions, which require different levels of expertise. They are all different. <br /><br />Angular, React and Vue are the top players among JavaScript frameworks for frontend development. They can all be used for literally any requirement, however each framework offers something it is extremely good at.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">You don&rsquo;t need React to build a static blog, but this technology will make a dynamic website work flawless.

If you were inspired by the example of a young Mark Zuckerberg, and you are just about to turn your idea into reality - slow down. Being in a hurry &nbsp;hurry won&rsquo;t guarantee your success, but smart planning will.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The first step to realizing a business idea should be a website or mobile app prototype, which is critical to prove the concept.</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">What is a prototype?&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/how-to-make-a-prototype/what-is-prototype.png" alt="what is a prototype" /></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">According to Wikipedia, &ldquo;A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept or process, or to act as a thing to be replicated or learned from.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">We can apply this definition to the information technology sphere as well. Compared to the minimum viable product (MVP), which is a minimum usable version of the product and includes the core functionality, the prototype doesn&rsquo;t perform anything. It is just an image of your future app.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">But the importance of a prototype is much greater than you can imagine.</p>\r\n<table style="width: 705px;">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style="width: 372px;">&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td style="width: 359px;">\r\n<p><em><strong>"If a picture is worth 1000 words,&nbsp;</strong></em><br /><em><strong>a prototype is worth 1000 meetings."</strong></em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: right;"><em><strong>John Maeda</strong></em></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Reasons to build a prototype</h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">A website or app prototype is a powerful tool for developing a successful product. It can save you hundreds of development hours and thousands of dollars.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Look at your idea from another perspective<strong><br /></strong><br />The idea in your head may seem perfect, but building a prototype makes the idea material. It enables you to see not just the advantages, but the weaknesses as well. Changing the perspective allows you to be more critical and discover any drawbacks of the idea.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Work with details<strong><br /></strong><br />When the idea is visual, you will quickly notice some gaps or imperfections. Improving it at the prototype stage will save you a lot of time and money.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Consider different solutions<strong><br /></strong><br />With your app you are targeting certain problems. A prototype allows you to test different solutions, and choose the one that best satisfies the needs of your target market. Moreover, a prototype is a great tool to conduct &nbsp;experiments with minimum risk.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Test with potential users<strong><br /></strong><br />If you have a mobile app prototype, it means you have something to show to your potential customers. Define your target audience and ask them to evaluate your prototype. You may be surprised at how much the opinion of potential users may differ from your own. Their feedback will show you how the product can be improved. Knowing what your customers need before the actual development is very valuable.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Talk to developers<strong><br /></strong><br />Developers often hear requests such as &ldquo;I want an app like Facebook. How much does it cost?&rdquo; &nbsp;But the phrase &ldquo;an app like Facebook&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t tell us anything about the complexity, the features, the number of screens, etc. The mobile app prototype, instead, does. Showing the development team a prototype will give them the exact description of your future product and will enable an exact cost estimation.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Talk to investors<strong><br /></strong><br />You may get your initial funding from your friends or family, your high school teacher or a real investor. Either way, you&rsquo;ll need to show them something that will convince them to invest in your idea. A prototype allows them to see and touch the product they are being asked to fund, which increases your chances of getting the money.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Advantages of prototyping</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Short development time<strong><br /></strong><br />Depending on the fidelity grade, the prototype can be created in several hours to several days. A short development time allows making numerous changes and testing different functionality without significant risks to the budget<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Doesn&rsquo;t require specific skills<strong><br /></strong><br />Even a non-tech person can build a simple prototype using a pen and paper. The prototyping tools for high-fidelity wireframes are usually not complicated to learn and to use. So you don&rsquo;t have to be a professional programmer or designer to build a prototype of your own product. And in this article, we will teach you how to make a prototype right.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Low price<strong><br /></strong><br />Prototypes are great for experiments and idea verification, since they don&rsquo;t take much time to develop, and the costs are usually low. So, you can try prototyping different functionality, or a different structure and design of the future app, without risking a huge amount of money.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">How to make a prototype? A step-by-step guide</h2>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The website or app prototype is a critical stage in developing a product. But, unfortunately, many entrepreneurs skip this and move straight to the development stage. As a result, mistakes in design and weaknesses of the product are discovered only after the release. As a result, too much time and money is spent solving &nbsp;problems that could have been prevented by proper prototyping.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">You may think that a prototype requires hiring a professional, but actually, you can do all the work yourself in a few hours. All you need is a pencil and a notepad, a laptop, and this step-by-step guide.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">So, it&rsquo;s time to start!</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Step 1. Start with a paper prototype&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/how-to-make-a-prototype/how-to-make-a-prototype-paper-prototype.png" alt="paper prototype" /></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The very first step is to sketch your idea on a sheet of paper. If you consider yourself to be a bad artist - don&rsquo;t let that stop you. A paper prototype isn&rsquo;t about art, it&rsquo;s about presenting the idea in a simplified way.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Take a sketchbook and a pen and try to put your idea on paper. To make it more visual, you can use a sketchbooks with phones templates on every page, or <a href="http://sketchsheets.com/">download and print such templates</a>. This allows you to get a clear view of how the app will look on the device screen.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">It is important to sketch all the screens of the app to get a clear structure. If your product &nbsp;includes many screens - present them on a single page, and add the connections.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">A pen-and-paper sketch is just a draft for an interactive prototype. So, at this stage, you should pay more attention to key items and their placement and not to the detailed design. The UI of the future app or website is born right now.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Besides the pictures, you can sketch additional information that will be helpful for the project. Describe your buyer personas - the potential clients who will pay to use your product. Describe the possible user journey through the application, their steps and their impressions. And remember, you aren&rsquo;t writing a novel, so don&rsquo;t aim for perfection in your writing. A paper prototype is just a raw visualization of your thoughts.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>Why are paper prototypes good?</strong></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Firstly, <strong>you can make them anytime, anywhere.</strong> Traveling on a train, walking the dog, watching the morning show - an idea can hit you unexpectedly. If you have a notepad and a pen, you are fully equipped for your first prototype. If not, check for other available material. Maybe you can grab several napkins from the nearest KFC.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Secondly, <strong>you don&rsquo;t need any background</strong> in programming or design to know how to make a paper prototype. An understanding of your future product is enough.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Thirdly, <strong>prototypes cost you almost nothing.</strong> You don&rsquo;t need expensive devices and prototyping tools to sketch the first model of your app. You won&rsquo;t have to pay anyone for making the prototype for you. Yes, it will take you some time, but believe me, you would spend much more time explaining what you actually to a developer.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">With a bit of creativity, your paper prototype can become interactive.<br /><span id="docs-internal-guid-f66fde42-99f4-5107-a9db-2095c70c8f19"></span></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-f66fde42-99f4-5107-a9db-2095c70c8f19">After the first paper prototype is ready, you can start showing it to other people. The visual presentation of your idea might be quite helpful for finding like-minded people, who will potentially join your team.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Step 2. Create a digital wireframe<br /><br /></h3>\r\n<div class="video-wrp"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/1H7Ql9hmbuM" width="560" height="314" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>\r\n<p dir="ltr">After the structure of the app is more or less clear, it&rsquo;s time to create a digital wireframe, which is a blueprint that represents the skeleton of the future app.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The term <em>digital wireframe</em> speaks for itself - it is created with the help of digital prototyping tools.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">If you really like your paper prototype and think it includes all the necessary UI elements - you can save time with <a href="https://popapp.in/">POP </a>(the abbreviation for Prototyping on Paper) by Marvel. It will help you transform a pen-and-paper prototype into a digital one. You just take photos of your sketches, and the tool will upload them as screens of your future app. It&rsquo;s even possible to add different types of interactions.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">There are also dozens of apps for professional prototyping as well. But don&rsquo;t let the word &ldquo;professional&rdquo; scare you. They are all easy to learn, and most of them have trials or free plans.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">One of our favorites is <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a> - a prototyping tool for creating digital wireframes and interactive prototypes. Using a rich library of ready UI elements you can build the layout of literally any type of app or website.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">InVision is the right tool if you are wondering how to make a prototype interactive. This means that you can add different transitions like swipe, tap, dissolve, etc. The interactive digital prototype looks like the ready application.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">InVision also enables project sharing via email, SMS, and URLs. Authorized users can also leave comments. Such applications are great when working with a remote team since you are not limited to one location.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Step 3. Share your prototype with people<br /><br /></h3>\r\n<div class="video-wrp"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ELYVpikRNEE" width="560" height="314" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The advantage of the digital wireframe is the ability to share it with anyone in any corner of the planet, which is impossible to do with the paper prototype. Digital prototyping tools enable you to share prototypes with whoever you want. InVision, for example, makes it possible to leave comments and discuss the website prototype online. So how to make a prototype work for you?</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>Share with friends.</strong> Ask for their opinion. Ideas from another perspective might be unexpected but quite valuable.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>Share with the designer.</strong> Having a skeleton of the product you can then involve a professional to create an attractive and friendly UI/UX design.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>Share with potential users.</strong> Contact your potential clients to get their feedback concerning the product and its logic. No one can understand the product better than people who are meant to use it.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>Share with investors.</strong> If you want to raise money, you have to show your potential investors something convincing, an interactive prototype, for example. The wireframe is a detailed and visual presentation of the idea, proving that you are serious about implementing it. Of course, you won&rsquo;t get millions of dollars straight away, but you may attract seed capital that will help you develop your product and start moving it forward.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>Share with developers.</strong> An app prototype is essential when placing your future product in the hands of the development team. It is a clear roadmap for them to know how the app should look, what functionality it should include, and how it should solve the users&rsquo; problems. With a prototype, you can ask for an accurate estimation of the development time and costs.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Step 4. HTML prototype</h3>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/how-to-make-a-prototype/html-prototype.png" alt="html prototype" /></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">By using HTML and CSS you can create a digital prototype, however, you&rsquo;ll have to involve another professional, unless you can code yourself. HTML and CSS are the most widely-used technologies, and it won&rsquo;t be an issue to find a developer who can create an interactive prototype for you.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The HTML prototype has one huge advantage - the code behind it is reusable. This means that you can use the same code (with slight improvements) to build the MVP (minimum viable product).</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">It is also important to mention that HTML prototyping is optional. It depends on how your business is currently going. If you have enough money to start the MVP development - do this. If you were able to test the idea with potential users and know exactly what features you should build for them - do this. If you have already gathered the team to run the business - do this. In all the other cases, move on to HTML prototyping.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">An HTML prototype has the highest fidelity grade. Since it is built with the same technologies as the end product, it shows exactly how the final product will look. Moreover, it allows testing whether or not the idea can be implemented with existing technologies.</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The website or app prototype is a safe and reliable tool to test an idea. It enables you to present the model of your future product to the potential users, receive their feedback and to improve it. The biggest advantage of prototyping is that you risk very little, but receive a lot of value: you test your idea, receive feedback and improve it, until it exactly matches the needs of the target market.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Visualizing the idea in a prototype is the very beginning of product development, which is usually followed by creating the MVP. Compared to the prototype, the MVP isn&rsquo;t a model, but a real working product with minimal but useful functionality.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The prototype is the first and highly-important step towards a successful product that people use, love and are willing to pay for.</p>',pageOgDescription:"What is the first step from a great idea to a successful project?

You&rsquo;ve probably read articles comparing the advantages and estimated cost of these types of apps.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The conclusions are always the same: if you have the money - build native apps; if you are low on budget - choose either a hybrid or a web app. However. this is a totally wrong approach!</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">You should not choose the type of app that you can afford, but the one that fits your needs.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">So, how do you decide between native, hybrid and web app development? Keep reading.</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">Web application</h2>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/hybrid-vs-native-vs-web/google-inbox-web-app.jpg" alt="" width="2870" height="1592" /></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Web app development is the cheapest option for delivering a mobile user experience. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean that web apps are a low-cost solution with limited quality. Sometimes they are sufficient to satisfy users&rsquo; expectations.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">A web app, just like any website, is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There are also web app frameworks - sets of tools which make the development process faster and more efficient. MeteorJS, React and Angular are the most popular JavaScript web development frameworks and one of the trends of 2018 on the web, just as Laravel for PHP.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Web applications were once considered a low-quality solution, but nowadays they are showing huge potential. The progressive web app (PWA) is a new blend of technologies that is changing the way we see traditional mobile browsing. PWAs aim to deliver a native-like experience through the mobile web browser, and surprisingly, they have succeeded! For more details, check out our article on progressive web apps.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Web apps are good for: news, weather, e-commerce, social apps, currency converters, expense managers, etc.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">If there is a ready website, the mobile web app is the fastest and easiest solution to deliver a handy experience to users. The great advantage is the ability to keep the backend of the web app, to adjust the frontend and, voila! - the mobile web application is ready to be placed into the users&rsquo; hands.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">In general, a web app may be a reasonable solution for applications that do not have a &nbsp;complicated frontend. It is also a good choice for developing an MVP, as the first version of the product can be launched without major expense, and in a very short time. This is crucial for building a minimum viable product.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Advantages of web applications</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Build the development team fast<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/hybrid-vs-native-vs-web/development- team.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="421" /><br /><br />Web apps use a widely spread web development technology, so finding a professional team won&rsquo;t be a big deal. Moreover, a single app is compatible with all mobile platforms, so there is no need to have several teams of programmers, each with a specific expertise;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Support every device, every platform and every version of OS<br />Every modern device has a browser. This is the only criteria to access web applications. Therefore, you need only one version of the app, which all users will access, regardless of the hardware and software they are using;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Fast deployment of new features<br />New features are implemented only once and these become instantly available to everyone. Users access only the latest version of the web app on their mobile browsers.

The&nbsp;<a href="http://digiday.com/publishers/uh-oh-ad-blocking-forecast-cost-35-billion-2020/">predictions&nbsp;</a>are that by 2020, advertisers will lose $35 billion because of ad blockers. So, if your web app relies on advertising, you should be aware of possible problems.<br /><br /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Examples of Web Apps</h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://stories.flipkart.com/introducing-flipkart-lite/">Flipkart Lite</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/">The Washington Post</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/admin/gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gmail</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a>.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Progressive web apps are a breakthrough in modern web development. They allow building cross-platform applications without significant disadvantages for the end user. If your future project is not a complex business app with extensive features, complex frontend and backend - you should consider building a PWA.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The time, when web applications were seen only as a cheap solution for new or small companies is already gone. Web apps are becoming a powerful business tool.</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">Native applications<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/hybrid-vs-native-vs-web/native-apps-collageb new.jpg" alt="" width="998" height="754" /></h2>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><br />Native apps are considered to be the most reliable, showing extraordinary performance when compared to hybrid and web apps.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Native apps are developed for a specific mobile platform using particular programming languages and technologies. IOS apps, for example, are written in Objective-C and Swift, Android apps in Java or Kotlin. C++ is used for native Windows and Blackberry apps.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">This means that a separate version of the app must be developed for each platform. You can&rsquo;t reuse any piece of code from another platform version, as it is written in a completely different programming language. Roughly, you take the app development time and multiply it by the number of platforms you want to support. That&rsquo;s why native app development is considered to be the most time-consuming and most expensive.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Native app development is preferred for: high-performance apps</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Advantages of native applications</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Access to built-in features of the device<br />The biggest advantage of native apps is that they can easily access all the built-in features of the device and the platform (camera, accelerometer, GPS, etc.). This ensures a seamless user experience and enables complex features to be implemented.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Native UI/UX<br /><img src="/img/blog/hybrid-vs-native-vs-web/ux-designe.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="421" /><br />Separate development for different platforms enables the user experience to be maximized by building in exceptional design using native UI elements.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Available from app stores<br />Customers are familiar with downloading apps from official app stores, which provides a powerful channel for mobile app distribution.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">SDK for developers<br />Software development kits (SDK) are sets of tools and libraries developers use to improve the development process. These are half-ready solutions, which developers can use to avoid having &nbsp;to build the application from scratch. These libraries ensure that the software interacts properly with the platform it is built for.&nbsp;<br />Most libraries work perfectly for developing native apps. They can also be used in hybrid app development, but this process is much more complicated due to the extra layers. There are SDKs for chats, push notifications, photo filtering etc. Literally any feature can be implemented with the help of a software development kit.<br /><br /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Disadvantages of native app development</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">High price and long development time<br />A separate app is developed for every platform. This significantly increases the development time and therefore the development cost.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Complicated and expensive maintenance and support<br />All updates must be done separately for each platform, which takes a long time and therefore incurs a higher cost. In addition, the user has to download updates from the app store, which is quite irritating for them if you plan to update the app often.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Content not seen by search engines<br />The content presented by the app is available only to app users and can&rsquo;t be accessed via search engines.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Support of multiple versions of the application<br />Users have to download updates from the app store. Some users don&rsquo;t do this and prefer to continue using an older version of the application. So the company has to simultaneously support multiple versions of the app.<br /><br /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Examples of native apps</h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Native apps are a popular solution nowadays. They deliver an exceptional user experience and are perfect for solving complicated tasks. Really good examples of native apps include: Google Maps (for&nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps-gps-navigation/id585027354?mt=8">iOS</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps&amp;hl=en">Android</a>), Facebook (for&nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/facebook/id284882215?mt=8">iOS</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.katana&amp;hl=en">Android</a>) and LinkedIn (for&nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/linkedin/id288429040?mt=8">iOS</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.linkedin.android&amp;hl=en">Android</a>). You&rsquo;ll definitely appreciate the exceptional performance delivered by the applications on both platforms.</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">Hybrid app development<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/hybrid-vs-native-vs-web/1.png" alt="" width="731" height="421" /><br /><br /></h2>\r\n<p dir="ltr">A hybrid app is, in a way, a compromise between web and native app development. It combines the advantages of both types of app development.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">A hybrid application is technically a web app packed in a native app container. Like the web app, it is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Unlike the web app, it is distributed through the app store or Over-the-Air for iOS devices. &nbsp;Another difference is that the hybrid app is reliant on the WebView and not the mobile browser.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">PhoneGap and Apache Cordova are the core tools for hybrid app development. They include APIs which allow the app to access the native functionality of the mobile device or platform. Apache Cordova was originally named PhoneGap. Nowadays PhoneGap is the distribution of Apache Cordova with some extended features. A lot of Cordova plugins have been developed and supported by the development community. It is also possible to create custom plugins to suit specific needs.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Ionic is a web UI framework often bundled with Apache Cordova or PhoneGap. Ionic is mostly responsible for beautiful and native-like applications. Cordova, PhoneGap and Ionic use JavaScript.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Xamarin is an analog version of Cordova for Microsoft fans. It allows writing cross-platform applications in the .NET and C# programming languages.&nbsp;<br /><br />Hybrid apps are good for:</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Banks, news, media and content delivery platforms.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Advantages of hybrid mobile apps</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Cross-platform<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/hybrid-vs-native-vs-web/search - engines.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="491" /><br /><br />Hybrid apps can be used on any type of the device, regardless the platform or version of the software. Apps and updates for different OS can be released simultaneously.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Web development technology<br />Hybrid apps use HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Similar to web apps, this allows development teams to be built quickly. Another advantage of the technology is the simultaneous deployment for different platforms.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Lower price<br />With the hybrid approach, developing an app for two or more platforms will be much cheaper.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Reaching a wider audience<br />Native app development usually focuses on iOS and Android, often forgetting about Windows and Blackberry users. Even though it only has &nbsp;about 1% of the whole market, there &nbsp;are still millions of users, who may be interested in &nbsp;your app.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Downloadable from the app store<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/hybrid-vs-native-vs-web/apps-markets.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="421" /><br /><br />Official app stores are an additional marketing channel for your app.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">No ad blockers<br />While advertisements can be easily blocked on the web, mobile apps are still resistant to this. So, to take advantage of in-app advertisements, hybrid or native apps are preferable.<br /><br /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Disadvantages of hybrid apps</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Limited performance<br />Hybrid apps are not as fast as native apps because they add an extra layer between the user and the app. That&rsquo;s why they are not suitable for &nbsp;performance-critical projects. For these cases native app development is preferable.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Not native look&rsquo;n&rsquo;feel<br />A single app cannot meet the expectations of all users of different platforms. That&rsquo;s why hybrid apps are a kind of compromise in UI/UX and don&rsquo;t feel native to the users.<br /><br /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Examples of hybrid apps</h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-88fe82e8-59cd-c8d0-f04d-c680f403d3e1">For many it is &nbsp;surprising to learn that some of the world&rsquo;s most popular mobile apps turn out to be&hellip;hybrid! This includes: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/mobile-apps/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=2350149011">Amazon </a>(for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/mw/app/amazon/id297606951?mt=8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.mShop.android.shopping&amp;hl=en">Android</a>), <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> (for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/evernote/id281796108?mt=8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evernote&amp;hl=en">Android</a>), <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> (for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/netflix/id363590051?mt=8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.mediaclient&amp;hl=en">Android</a>). You can check out both versions of these apps to make sure that the user experience offered is on a high level, in most cases indistinguishable from the native applications. </span></p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p dir="ltr">One of the most important steps in mobile app development is deciding on the approach you will be using. Web apps are less expensive but are not suitable for all types of apps. Native apps are the most expensive to develop, but ensure the highest quality product and the best user experience. Hybrid apps are somewhere in between. They mostly have a native look-n-feel, but usually lack performance, although the development process is fast and easy, allowing saving in development costs.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The fact is that every app development project is highly individual, so bear in mind that all the information above is just general advice.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Still can&rsquo;t decide which type of app will be the best for your project?</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">T</a><a href="/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ell us&nbsp;</a>your concerns and your doubts, we are here to help.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>',pageOgDescription:"Web and hybrid apps a bad, native apps are expensive.

in web development. Get rid of these until the end of 2018",pageTags:["Technology"],pageContent:'<p>It is usual for tech blogs to start the year with an article like &ldquo;X trends of the year&rdquo; or &ldquo;Top predictions for industry Y&rdquo;. So did we, and you have probably already read our research about the <a title="https://clockwise.software/blog/web-development-trends-in-2018" href="/blog/web-development-trends-in-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trends in web development for the year 2018. </a></p>\r\n<p>But to be consistent, we decided to describe the anti-trends of the year as well. These are the technologies, approaches, techniques that are very popular among website owners, but are rather annoying and unfriendly for the users or negatively affect website conversions.</p>\r\n<p>So, here comes the list of the anti-trends on the web. Make sure you get rid of them before the end of the year. Your users will be really thankful.</p>\r\n<h2>HTTP</h2>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/web-development-anti-trends/anti-trends-sections_http-to-https.jpg" alt="http to https" width="730" height="420" /></p>\r\n<p>HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is responsible for the communication between the server and the web browser. Data that is transferred via this protocol is not encrypted.</p>\r\n<p>Earlier, this was the issue mainly for e-commerce websites, which transferred sensitive data such as payment details or shipment addresses.</p>\r\n<p>Nowadays, the security of personal information and therefore website security is becoming more important in web development.</p>\r\n<p>To solve the problem HTTPS was introduced, where S stands for &ldquo;secure&rdquo;. The communication between the server and the browser via this protocol is encrypted so that personal data is completely safe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As the part of the campaign for secure internet, Google is starting to label HTTP websites as insecure. The <a title="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/09/moving-towards-more-secure-web.html" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/09/moving-towards-more-secure-web.html">latest version of Chrome browser will indicate</a> to users who enter personal data on an HTTP website that the data will not be secure. Of course, these websites will lose credibility.</p>\r\n<p>And in addition to that, HTTPS websites will rank higher in search results.</p>\r\n<p>So, if you don&rsquo;t want your website to be displayed with the &ldquo;Not secure&rdquo; label by the world&rsquo;s most popular browser, transfer to HTTPS as soon as possible.</p>\r\n<p>To make the internet more secure, <a title="https://letsencrypt.org/" href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&rsquo;s Encrypt</a> has introduced free encryption certificates. So, if you previously didn&rsquo;t want to spend extra money to secure your website with upgraded Hypertext Transfer Protocol now you have no more excuses to remain on the dark side of the web.</p>\r\n<h2>Aggressive pop-ups</h2>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/web-development-anti-trends/agressive-popup-shit-bitch.gif" alt="agressive popups" width="730" height="420" /></p>\r\n<p>Pop-ups are a great marketing invention aimed to boosting website conversions, however, after a few wrong turns they became so much aggressive and annoying, that people can&rsquo;t stand seeing them on their screens.</p>\r\n<p>Pop-ups on websites usually aim to advertise a product or service or to exchange the user&rsquo;s email for some useful piece of content.</p>\r\n<p>These advertisements became extremely aggressive when they started to &ldquo;offend&rdquo; the readers who refused to accept the offers.</p>\r\n<p>Elle, for example, offered an article titled "32 Surprising Things That Are Destroying Your Skin". Website visitors could accept it and add their emails to the database, or click "No thanks, I&rsquo;m not interested in protecting my skin." Personally, when I see this kind of aggressive marketing, I usually close the tab immediately, even though I may miss out on reading an interesting article.</p>\r\n<p>Yes, the pop-ups are good for website conversions, but they aren&rsquo;t user-friendly at all. Any negative emotion experienced by visitors to your website decreases their loyalty to your brand.</p>\r\n<p>But if displeasing your users isn&rsquo;t enough to convince you to say &ldquo;NO&rdquo; to annoying pop-ups, then you should think twice about displeasing Google. The <a title="http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/23/12610890/google-search-punish-pop-ups-interstitial-ads" href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/23/12610890/google-search-punish-pop-ups-interstitial-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search engine may rank the website lower</a> if it discovers inappropriate pop-ups.</p>\r\n<p>So, make your marketing less obtrusive and more user-friendly.</p>\r\n<h2>Low website speed and heavy pages</h2>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/web-development-anti-trends/anti-trends-sections_slow.jpg" alt="low website speed" width="731" height="421" /></p>\r\n<p>The web is getting faster every day, and the speed of website is now more crucial than ever. <a title="https://www.digitalnext.com.au/blog/the-need-for-website-speed/" href="https://www.digitalnext.com.au/blog/the-need-for-website-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40% of the users leave a website</a> if it takes more than three seconds to load. And as the competition in web development continues to rise, this intolerance may even increase.</p>\r\n<p>Website speed directly affects conversions and revenue. Walmart and Amazon, for example, <a title="https://fortunelords.com/website-speed/" href="https://fortunelords.com/website-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported </a>1% loss in revenue per 100 ms of site load delay. And the conversions of Walmart increased by 2% for every one second of load time improvement.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, the speed of the website is one of the important ranking factors. By improving it you will please both your clients and the search engine.</p>\r\n<p>If your website experiences some load speed issues, check the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Server. Your website, with all the information and data, is stored on a server. How quick this data is sent to the browser defines the load speed of your website. The location and performance of the server are critical. Also, the more visitors come to your website, the more time it takes for the server to respond. <a title="https://gtmetrix.com/why-use-a-cdn.htm" href="https://gtmetrix.com/why-use-a-cdn.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDN or content delivery network</a> may be a solution. This is a network of servers located all over the world. When a user requests a website, the node that is closest will respond, delivering the fastest load speed.</li>\r\n<li>Large images. They just load slowly. The same applies to complex file formats. If your website needs optimization, check whether the images are JPG, PNG or GIF (these are the most speed-friendly), and compress them to the appropriate size.</li>\r\n<li>Excessive code. Every line of code takes time to run. If your website contains unoptimized code, this can make it significantly slower.</li>\r\n<li>Unnecessary redirects between the pages. Every redirect is another headache of web development that increases the load time</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Gone through this checklist but still haven&rsquo;t found the reason of the low website speed? Let us help you with this. Contact us for a free website inspection.</p>\r\n<p>Website conversion rate and website speed are indeed correlated. That&rsquo;s why we recommend that you pay attention to this factor.</p>\r\n<h2>&nbsp;Preloaders<br /><img src="/img/blog/web-development-anti-trends/preloader.gif" alt="preloader" width="730" height="420" /></h2>\r\n<p>What can be more irritating than a slow website? A slow preloader, of course.</p>\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t even imagine, where this idea came from. If the preloader was aimed at entertaining users while waiting - it completely failed. Preloaders are really boring. Should it indicate the load progress? Maybe, but it won&rsquo;t make your potential customer wait longer. Seeing the load progress 7% - 9% - 12% over several seconds may actually convince visitors to leave the page immediately.</p>\r\n<p>The preloader makes the website visitors focus on how slow the website is.</p>\r\n<p>So, if you have a preloader on your website - remove it and check the website load speed. If you plan to add a preloader - forget this and pay more attention to the website load speed.</p>\r\n<h2>Hamburger menu</h2>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/web-development-anti-trends/anti-trends-sections_hamburger.jpg" alt="hamburger menu" width="731" height="421" /><br />Hidden website navigation, particularly hamburger menus, became a trend in web development about two years ago. But nowadays it is clear that <a title="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with hamburger menu the user experience goes down</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The reason is simple - this type of menu is less discoverable. Users often don&rsquo;t notice the hidden navigation and simply pass by. If they click the hamburger icon, they do this significantly later compared to clicking a visible menu.</p>\r\n<p>Using the hamburger menu could be excused for mobile phones. The limited screen size forces the website developers to hide some menu tabs behind a simple icon. But doing so on the desktop is certainly useless.</p>\r\n<p>An experiment conducted by Nielsen Norman Group <a title="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed </a>that on desktops 27% of website visitors tapped on the hidden website navigation, compared to 50% of users who tapped on mixed navigation, and 48% on the visible navigation. On mobiles, 57% of users reached for the hidden navigation, and 86% used the half-visible one.<br /><br />This proves the statement that the hamburger menu is less discoverable and causes a bad user experience. Therefore, some content may remain undiscovered by the website visitors.</p>\r\n<p>If you want to see your users click through the website and reach the content you prepared for them - think of alternatives for the hamburger menu. You can check some <a title="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2016/11/4-fresh-alternatives-to-the-hamburger-menu/" href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2016/11/4-fresh-alternatives-to-the-hamburger-menu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, or ask our designer for some fresh and captivating ideas.</p>\r\n<h2>Complicated website navigation</h2>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/web-development-anti-trends/anti-trends-sections_pop-ups.jpg" alt="сomplicated website navigation" width="731" height="421" /></p>\r\n<p>Yes, one more website navigation anti-trend and not surprisingly it is about simplifying the user&rsquo;s journey through the website.</p>\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s assume, there is a website with a large number of pages that describe the company, its services, portfolio, testimonials, prices, special offers, etc. Every page contains a short text, perhaps some images and several links to other pages on the website. Every single page is reachable from the homepage via a multi-level drop down menu.</p>\r\n<p>Everything seems to be logical. But a drop down menu makes the navigation through the website far more complicated for users who need more time to find the information they are interested in and sometimes they leave without ever finding it.</p>\r\n<p>The trend for simplicity in web design shows us the alternative - one-page websites. As we already mentioned in our article about web development trends of 2017, one-pagers accumulate all the essential information within one page. The user only has to scroll down.</p>\r\n<p>This approach is highly appreciated by the mobile users, who can acсess the necessary information just by scrolling. Moreover, the website owner has a certain control over the information flow perceived by the user.</p>\r\n<h2>Flash website</h2>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/web-development-anti-trends/anti-trends-sections_flash.jpg" alt="flash website" width="731" height="420" /></p>\r\n<p>All the hype around the <a title="https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/" href="https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">death of Flash</a> has had some consequences. It&rsquo;s now almost impossible to find a web development company that will build a Flash website. But at the same time, a lot of existing websites are still sticking to this old-school technology. But it is worth considering saying farewell to it because Flash:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>is very CPU intensive;</li>\r\n<li>has cross-platform support issues;</li>\r\n<li>isn&rsquo;t mobile-friendly.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>And the most convincing argument against Flash is that it is no longer supported by the majority of modern browsers. So if you still want your visitors to have full impressions from your website - consider saying good bye to Flash. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The alternative is obvious - HTML5. It delivers better user experience and simplifies the development process. HTML5 is a popular technology nowadays, so finding a team of experienced developers is not an issue. Moreover, the active developer community is always ready to help with advice if needed.</p>\r\n<p>So, if your website still runs Flash - it&rsquo;s high time to update to HTML5.</p>\r\n<h2>Ignoring ad blockers</h2>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/web-development-anti-trends/anti-trends-sections_ad.jpg" alt="ad blockers" width="731" height="421" /></p>\r\n<p>Web surfers try to avoid annoying advertisements on every web page and use ad blockers to do this. These are considered to be a great invention to save time on the web.</p>\r\n<p>However, imagine a situation where an individual publisher has a website that provides useful information for free. Thousands of people visit the site every day to receive fresh updates. Advertising is the only source of income for the website owner and the authors who place content on the site. However, some visitors have set their browsers up to block the ads. This causes the site owner to lose a lot of money which could be spent on supporting the website and improving the content. Do you still think ad blockers are great?</p>\r\n<p>Publishers are losing a huge amount of money, and the sum <a title="http://www.business2community.com/infographics/ad-blocking-rise-statistics-trends-01435073#rHvfrGhzM3bl8kk4.97" href="http://www.business2community.com/infographics/ad-blocking-rise-statistics-trends-01435073#rHvfrGhzM3bl8kk4.97" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doubles every year</a>: $11 billion in 2014, $22 billion in 2015, $42 in 2016. Ignoring this ad blocking trend is a big mistake. There is actually a solution!</p>\r\n<p>Ask your readers to whitelist you! This may sound weird, but most users are willing to turn on the ads on your particular website in exchange for some valuable content you have to offer. You can add an unobtrusive pop-up, or redirect readers to a page where you politely ask them to add the website to their ad blocker whitelist.</p>\r\n<p>Such messages may also increase visitor&rsquo;s loyalty, as they are likely to feel satisfied for supporting such a useful product.</p>\r\n<p>Enough to suffer from ad blockers. It&rsquo;s time to build a closer relationship with your customers. Ask them to help you earn money by showing them the ad.</p>\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p>Websites are different, and so are their visitors. But there are things that are equally annoying for everyone. We hope that this summary of web anti-trends has convinced you to pay more attention to users&rsquo; experience, instead of just blindly chasing website conversions.</p>\r\n<p>Web development is evolutionizing every day. Things that were highly appreciated some time ago become outdated and even annoying. Get rid of them on your website. Your visitors will reward you with their attention!</p>\r\n<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>',pageOgDescription:"Are you interested in web development trends of the coming year?

Was it a brand new tablet, a pair of cute slippers or a cooking book?</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Internet purchases are growing in popularity every single day. We prefer online shops to physical ones because they are fast, offer a wide variety of products and a very convenient process for buying and paying.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Just a few years ago online shopping wasn&rsquo;t as easy and quick as it is today. The main issue was a complicated payment process. Online transactions were still a dream. To pay for the online purchase the buyer had to print the receipt, go to the nearest bank within certain operating hours and wait for the seller to receive money, which usually took several days.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Payment was a real challenge and made everyone think twice before buying something on the internet.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Today, online payments occur in just seconds and are even easier than sending an SMS. This has spurred the enormous growth of online purchases. In addition to that, <a href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/traditional/online-shoppers-spend-more-impulse-buy-more-frequently-in-store-26591/">every third buyer admits</a> to having made an impulse purchase online at least once. The obvious reason for this is the ease and speed of the buying and payment process.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The growth of e-commerce became possible due to payment gateways - the services that make online purchases instant. If you already own, or are about to create an online shopping project, the right gateway will be a crucial contributor to your success.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Not all payment gateways are the same. Compatibility, payment methods, supported currencies and different fees&hellip; How to choose a payment gateway to fit your needs? This article will answer your questions.</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">What is a payment gateway and how does it work?<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/how-to-choose-a-payment-gateway/what is payment gateway.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="421" /></h2>\r\n<p dir="ltr">According to Wikipedia, a &ldquo;payment gateway is a merchant service provided by an e-commerce application service provider that authorizes credit card or direct payment processing for e-businesses, online retailers, bricks and clicks, or traditional brick and mortar.&rdquo; In other words, it is the middleman between buyers and sellers, and is responsible for the quick and secure transfer of money.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The payment gateway encrypts the sensitive data that are sent between the buyer, the seller and the bank. All sensitive data are stored on a secure server of the gateway.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">To better understand the process of online payments, take a look at this video:</p>\r\n<div class="video-wrp" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/GUurzvS3DlY" width="560" height="314" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>\r\n<p dir="ltr">So, a payment gateway is an irreplaceable tool for online businesses, however, which one is right for your particular case? Answering the following questions will help you to choose a payment gateway that will perfectly match the needs of your website or app.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Do you need a merchant account to receive payments?</h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">A merchant account is a special bank account that enables a business to receive different kinds of payments including credit and debit card payments directly. Earlier, payment gateways required all online store owners to have such an account. However, modern technologies enable the withdrawal of funds from the buyer&rsquo;s account, with the proceeds deposited into the sellers account.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Gateways that don&rsquo;t require a merchant account seem to be a good choice, since they don&rsquo;t force you to create a new bank account. However, they usually charge higher fees so be ready to pay more for the convenience.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">If opening another bank account isn&rsquo;t an issue for you, a classic payment gateway paired with a merchant account is a good choice. You will spend more time setting up the system, but you&rsquo;ll save a lot in a long-term perspective.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Do you prefer a hosted or integrated gateway?<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/how-to-choose-a-payment-gateway/making desicion.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="421" /></h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Your users don&rsquo;t care whether you are using a merchant account to receive the payments, however, the difference between the hosted and integrated gateway will directly affect the payment process.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The difference between these two types of payment gateways is that the integrated gateways let your buyers enter their payment data while they are on your website; the hosted gateways redirect users to the payment processor&rsquo;s platform.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">PayPal, for example, is a classical example of a hosted gateway. The users have to enter and confirm their payment information on the page of the service. The benefit of such an approach is clear. The buyers believe PayPal to be a reliable service that can be trusted with their sensitive data, and are therefore more likely to complete the checkout and confirm the payment.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">An integrated gateway allows users to input their payment data without leaving your website. For them this is a seamless process. But this type of payment gateway will work well only if your website is secure enough, since all payment details will be stored on your server.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">When choosing the type of the payment gateway you should also take into account the countries where you are going to sell your goods or services. In some countries hosted gateways are considered to be more secure, while others have more trust in integrated gateways.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Is the payment gateway easy to integrate with your website?<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/how-to-choose-a-payment-gateway/website integration payments .png" alt="" width="2500" height="1158" /></h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Some payment gateways offer simple integration with the e-commerce websites. In some cases this means that the integration can be performed without the programming skills. All you have to do is paste the piece of code with the API key provided by the gateway in your webpage. After this, the payment button will appear. When the button is pressed, the buyer will be redirected to the website of the payment system to enter data required to complete the payment.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">As you may have already guessed, such an easy integration is possible only in case of hosted gateways. The changes are done only on the frontend of your website. All the internal processes occur on the gateway&rsquo;s server.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The integrated services require the work of a professional developer, since the processes will be run in the backend of your own website. The backend integration with the API of the payment gateway enables your website to accept, process and send the data to the payment system, as well as process the result of the payment and update customer data in your system.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Integrated payment gateways require the work of a developer. The hosted gateways are usually easy to integrate, and by following the detailed instructions provided by the gateway you will be able to do this yourself.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Which currencies and merchant locations does the gateway support?<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/how-to-choose-a-payment-gateway/currency.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="421" /></h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">A lot of modern gateways enable you to receive payments in the majority of available currencies. But don&rsquo;t let this fact mislead you.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The supported currencies means that merchants are able to receive payments from customers that use these currencies, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that merchants can be located in countries where these currencies are in use.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">To explain this with an example, imagine that you have chosen a gateway that supports both American and Canadian dollars, but the merchant location is limited to the USA only. Accordingly, your business must be located in the USA, but you will be able to receive payments from customers in the USA and Canada.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The number of merchant locations that each gateway supports is usually limited, so double check whether your country is on the list before making the final decision. If your business has several locations, you will have to choose an international payment gateway.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Does the gateway support the payment methods of the target market?</h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Investigating your buyer persona can uncover many interesting facts which will help you choose the right payment gateway. In which countries do your customers live? Which currencies do they use to pay? Which payment methods do they prefer?</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Actually, the preferred payment methods depend on your clients&rsquo; country of residence. Different payment methods are popular in different regions. Credit cards, Visa, MasterCard and PayPal are used worldwide and should definitely be among the available payment methods, regardless of the target market. If your customers live in the USA, don&rsquo;t forget to add American Express. Your Russian clients will be happy if you allow them to pay with Webmoney, Kiwi or Yandex.Money.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Consider adding regional payment methods along with the global ones, as this will take you one step closer towards satisfying your clients.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">What are the payment gateways fees?<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/how-to-choose-a-payment-gateway/fees.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="421" /></h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The costs of the payment gateway will play a significant role in your choice of service provider. Payment gateways usually have different types of fees and it is not easy to choose the most appropriate one. You should pay attention to the following types of fees:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Setup fee/registration fee (one-time payment);</li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Monthly fee;</li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Transaction fee/payment processing fee/credit card processing fee (charged as a percentage or a fixed fee on every transaction);</li>\r\n<li dir="ltr">Chargeback fee.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir="ltr">The fees may change according to how your business grows. The companies sometimes offer lower fees for large clients. That means, the more transactions your payment gateway processes from your website or app, the lower the transaction fees will be.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Some of the popular payment gateways offer a free setup, while some charge a one-time payment up to $50. The transaction fees are usually 2.9% + $0.30 and can be higher or lower, depending on the service provider.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">What are the terms of the contract?<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/how-to-choose-a-payment-gateway/contract.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="421" /></h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">You may, at some stage, want to change your payment gateway service provider. This can occur for a variety of reasons, but usually it is due to the growth of the business, expanding to other markets, or a change in the demand for products or services.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">In order to avoid surprises after selecting a payment gateway, find out everything you can about the conditions of service before making your final decision.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Some providers may specify a minimum contract length, while others will allow you to terminate at any time. A fee may apply if the service is terminated before the end of the contract.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Another crucial point is data portability. Some gateways (including the popular PayPal) don&rsquo;t allow you to access your customers&rsquo; data.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">This means that, after moving to another payment gateway, you will have to ask your users to enter their payment data again. This may not seem to be a major issue, however it will frustrate some customers.</p>\r\n<h3 dir="ltr">Can I count on professional support?<br /><br /><img src="/img/blog/how-to-choose-a-payment-gateway/technical support.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="421" /></h3>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Almost all service providers promise you professional support, but this does not always occur in practiсe. A never-ending queue in the call center, and email answers that arrive days after you send your request to the support team - no service provider will reveal this on their website. But real customers are aware of this.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Professional and timely support is important - especially when you are dealing with money. So take into account the user feedback about the support service - it may affect your choice.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">But sometimes poor customer support is compensated with a strong and ready-to-help community. Either way, before choosing the payment gateway, make sure that you won&rsquo;t be left without a way to resolve technical problems.</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p dir="ltr">A stable payment gateway is an important tool for developing a business on the internet. Choosing the wrong service provider may frustrate your customers and prevent your business from growing.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">At the same time, there are a lot of things to consider to ensure that you choose the right payment gateway for your project. Does the service support your location, the currencies and the payment methods of your target market? What are the credit card processing fees that you will be charged? Will the rates change as your business grows? Will you be able to change to another service provider without any termination fees? Can you rely on professional support from the company or at least the user community?</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">If you still doubt which payment gateway will best fit the needs of your e-commerce project - we are here to help.

Something, thought wasn&rsquo;t possible previously.</p>\r\n<p class="intro">But in case of progressive web apps, the word evolution is much more applicable. PWAs bring the traditional web to a completely new level engaging users through a first-class experience and leaving the native mobile apps far behind.</p>\r\n<h2>So, what are progressive web apps?</h2>\r\n<p>Actually, the PWA doesn&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel. The simplest possible definition may sound like this: a progressive web app is a <strong>website that feels like a native mobile app</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>It feels like, but it isn&rsquo;t a mobile app. The PWA aims to bring native-like experience to users of all platforms and all devices. At the same time, it allows users to skip app store browsing and installation. Technically this is just another tab in your browser, but it has quick access right from the home screen and smooth app-like interactions. And it can work without an internet connection!</p>\r\n<h2>What aren&rsquo;t progressive web apps?</h2>\r\n<p>A progressive web app should seamlessly work on any type of device, regardless of the operating system. That&rsquo;s why it is often confused with hybrid mobile apps based on Cordova, React Native, NativeScript, Electron, NW.js etc.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, these are two completely different things. Hybrid apps are executable files, that should be downloaded from the app store and installed locally on a particular smartphone. PWAs aren&rsquo;t available neither in iTunes nor in Google Play Market or any other app store. They are accessible as a tab in your browser until you save them as a shortcut to your home screen.</p>\r\n<h2>Progressive web app structure</h2>\r\n<p>The progressive web app has a simple structure. It consists of the app shell and the changing content.</p>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/progressive-web-apps-the-new-word-in-user-engagement/pwa-structure.png" alt="PWA structure" /></p>\r\n<p>The <strong>app shell</strong> is the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code which build the interface of the app. The interface is the static part of the app, it can dynamically display the content. The app shell is cached on the device of the user and can be loaded immediately.</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>content</strong> is the dynamic part, it changes and is refreshed every time connection with the internet is established.</p>\r\n<p>There is one more technology, that allows us to define a PWA as a PWA. Its name is the service worker.</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>service worker</strong> is a JavaScript file that operates in the background. It is responsible for the offline functionality of the progressive web app through timely content caching.</p>\r\n<p>Also, important is the <strong>app manifest</strong>, a simple JSON file. It helps the device to recognize the PWA and defines how it will be displayed on the screen.</p>\r\n<h2>Distinctive features of a PWA</h2>\r\n<p>According to <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/">Google Developers</a>, a progressive web application needs to fulfill 10 key concepts in order to be recognized as a PWA. So, the app should be:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Progressive\r\n<p>The initial idea of a PWA is the possibility of using it on every device regardless of the browser. So, even if the browser doesn&rsquo;t support any of the technologies that are essential for PWA, the information should be accessible as a simple website.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Responsive\r\n<p>In addition to the ability to work with all browsers, the progressive web app should be compatible with any device, any form factor: mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop. The size of the screen should not be an issue.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Connectivity independent\r\n<p>The PWA should be able to work with a low-quality internet connection or without any connection at all. To achieve this you should use service workers, which cache the information and display it afterwards.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Fresh\r\n<p>The app shell is cached once and is instantly loaded. The service workers take care of the dynamic content, which is automatically downloaded when the device is connected to the network, so that the PWA displays the latest content available.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>App-like\r\n<p>Similar to a mobile app, the PWA has a static shell. To make the PWA feel like a native app the shell should include app-style interactions, navigation etc. The progressive web app&rsquo;s appearance and operation should not remind the user he is currently in a browser.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Safe\r\n<p>Progressive web apps that use online banking, online shopping order forms or other type of sensitive data should take care of their safety. To protect the information that is processes in the app, the connection should be served via the secure protocol HTTPS. This means, that all connections between the browser and the website are encrypted and therefore safe.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Discoverable\r\n<p>The web app manifest provides information about the progressive web application making it visible to the search engines and discoverable for users. The properties of the manifest define how the app will be saved on the home screen and how it will be opened in the browser.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Re-engageable\r\n<p>The web app push-notifications make the customers return to the website. Every time the content changes the user is notified, which encourages him to check the changes. The service workers and the push API allow the PWAs to send messages to the Android notification bar.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Installable\r\n<p>If the user visits a website several times, he is offered to save it as a shortcut to the home screen of the smartphone or browser. No need to browse the app store, no installation required. The PWA is saved immediately.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Linkable\r\n<p>This really cool feature enables sharing the link to the PWA with anyone, which is much quicker and more convenient than recommending to download an app.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Benefits</h2>\r\n<p>Progressive web apps are often compared with native mobile apps. Even though they are not direct competitors, you may find the advantages of a PWA quite valuable:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Not available in the app store\r\n<p>Looks more like a disadvantage, doesn&rsquo;t it? Actually, publishing an app to Google Play or iTunes doesn&rsquo;t guarantee hundreds of downloads. Even worse, the application tends to get lost among hundreds of similar apps without ever being found by users.</p>\r\n<p>The progressive web app has a simpler algorithm of being discovered. When the user visits your website, he is already using your PWA and can save it as a shortcut to his home screen with one single tap.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Works offline\r\n<p>Sounds insane, but a PWA is a website that can work without an internet connection. Service workers are here to ensure this. They cache the information when the device is online and are ready to display it at any time when the connection is poor or absent.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Always the latest version\r\n<p>Mobile apps updates can be annoying for the users. But this never happens to PWA users. Progressive web applications are actually websites, so you always access the latest version of them without any downloads.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Loads instantly\r\n<p>You probably know that users tend to leave the website if it doesn&rsquo;t load quickly. Progressive web applications solve this problem easily. For the first time, the PWA is loaded with an average speed. But all the next app loads are almost instant.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the app shell, which is saved on the device and the cached content the information is displayed without any delay. PWAs load faster than native apps and faster than mobile websites.</p>\r\n<p>Look how it works on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/">washingtonpost.com</a> on a 2G network:</p>\r\n<p style="position: relative; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><iframe style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; left: 0;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/buUavVWMOkU?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Improves user engagement\r\n<p>Even when not running, the progressive web app can send notifications about the content change, helping to re-engage the user even if he has already closed the PWA. But it is important to make sure that the notification is up-to-date and requires immediate reaction. Otherwise, the user might be annoyed with unnecessary web app notifications and turn off this nice re-engagement tool.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Direct URLs\r\n<p>This web app feature allows the user to share the PWA with everyone around. And it is much easier and faster than sending links to a native app download page. The progressive web application is accessible in one click.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Disadvantages</h2>\r\n<p>We have discovered only one major disadvantage so far. But if you dig deeper into the question, you may find out that this is actually not a big issue.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Service workers are not supported by Safari\r\n<p>Yes, service workers are the key technology of a PWA. Without it, the app won&rsquo;t be accessible when the iPhone or iPad is offline. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean that when launching a progressive web application you are going to lose such a big part of the market.</p>\r\n<p>The website can be viewed in Safari or any other browser, both on the desktop and mobile devices. So, the users of the Apple devices will still have access to your progressively built website and can enjoy the improved experience.</p>\r\n<p>Also, remember that we are talking about a rapidly changing environment. Something, that is not supported now, may become а standard in a very short time.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Progressive web app examples</h2>\r\n<p>Progressive web apps have already been successfully implemented by some of world\'s leading companies. Let us inspire you with some impressive outcomes.</p>\r\n<h2>Flipkart Lite</h2>\r\n<p><a href="https://www.flipkart.com/">Flipkart Lite</a> is one of the progressive web app examples to mention. The biggest e-commerce website in India Flipkart shut down their mobile website in 2015 and focused on delivering value through native mobile apps. But later it found the solution for a better user experience and presented its progressive web application. Surprisingly, Flipkart reported about a 70% increase in conversions.</p>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/progressive-web-apps-the-new-word-in-user-engagement/flipkart-conversion.png" alt="Flipkart reported about 70% increase in conversions" /></p>\r\n<p>Why did this work? Well, there are several reasons. Firstly, 63% of users access the website via a 2G network, which means slow connection and long load times. The PWA minimized this problem because the website became available offline as well. Users now can browse their previous searches and recently visited categories as they are stored in the cache.</p>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/progressive-web-apps-the-new-word-in-user-engagement/flipkart-percents.png" alt="Flipkart iconography" /></p>\r\n<p>According to Flipkart reports, around 60% of all users come to the PWA via the home screen icon. The user engagement is now 40% higher than before.</p>\r\n<p style="position: relative; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><iframe style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; left: 0;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MxTaDhwJDLg?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>\r\n<h2>AliExpress</h2>\r\n<p>The worldwide known e-commerce giant <a href="https://ru.aliexpress.com/">AliExpress</a> also decided to experiment with progressive web app technology and the results were quite impressive.</p>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/progressive-web-apps-the-new-word-in-user-engagement/aliexpress-conversion.png" alt="AliExpress conversion rates were doubled" /></p>\r\n<p>Combining the best features of the native mobile apps and the website the company launched the PWA and noticed, that the duration of sessions increased by an average of 74%. The conversion rates were doubled and conversion on Safari browsers also increased by 82%. An inspiring progressive web app example, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>\r\n<p><img src="/img/blog/progressive-web-apps-the-new-word-in-user-engagement/safari-conversion.png" alt="Conversion on Safari" /></p>\r\n<h2>The Washington Post</h2>\r\n<p>Add a comment to this line <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/">The Washington Post</a> turned the progressive web app into a default mobile experience for their users.</p>\r\n<p>After launching the beta version of the website they noticed a nearly fivefold increase in engagement. The differences between iOS and Android metrics were minimal. From this we can deduce that even though Apple doesn&rsquo;t support some of the core features of the progressive web apps, the improved experience they deliver matters a lot.</p>\r\n<p>The examples of The Washington Post and AliExpress prove that by developing the PWA the business doesn&rsquo;t give up the big market of iOS users. Just the opposite, it allows to deliver a progressive mobile web experience which dramatically increases conversion rates.</p>\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p>Native mobile apps once seemed to be the breakthrough in the tech world. But nowadays it is clear: it&rsquo;s too early for the mobile websites to give up. Progressive web applications combine the best features of the website and the mobile app delivering a unique user experience. They are fast, they work without an internet connection and they are great in re-engaging users.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is it worth investing in PWAs</strong>? Definitely, yes. This is the evolution of the mobile experience.</p>\r\n<p>Looking for someone to answer your questions concerning PWAs?
