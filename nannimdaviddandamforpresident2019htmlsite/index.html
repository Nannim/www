    This is us. This is our legacy. This is what we expect our children to believe,<br>
    because it is true, this is Nigerian and we would be smart to keep<br>
    it that way. Unfortunately, to do that will take unorthodox measures<br>
    because all we have done from the begining of Nigeria<br>
    from independence to date even though a battle fought for us, by the<br>
    brave ones of our kind agains elements that are determined to set<br>
    us back for their unholy profit, has put us on a journey that shone<br>
    its woes into reflection through our economic decline, our increase<br>
    in the crime rate, the destruction of any production initiative and<br>
    resorting to a vampiric feeding on every resource we have with no<br>
    consideration whatsoever for the future, a complete sidelining of merit<br>
    and the use of the unofficial, official man-know-man policy which would<br>
    be okay if it did not remove the able people from where they are needed<br>
    the most to just anywhere because somebody else has taken thier habitat<br>
    because that person also lost theirs the same way and the vicious cycle<br>
    continues. We have to open our arms amd embrace our dear Country, Nigeria,<br>
    how far we have brought her and how things must change now for the better<br>
    instead of complaining we must stand for common sense and choose right.<br>
    One day when we are looked up to by the world and it marvels at all that<br>
    we have accomplished, and we have our friends, parents, teachers, elders, <br>
    leaders and our descendants look into our eyes and ask how we did it <br>
    we will know and say we made a choice and before and after that, when we<br>
    are asked by anyone why we made a choice, we will look at them straight in <br>
    the eyes and say "we did it for you, for an example and an inspiration".<br>
    <br>
    <p>
      To cut the very, very long story short, <br>
      Nigeria needs more,<br>
      more than we have ever had,<br>
      more than we think is possible to have,<br>
      more than we can get from oil,<br>
      more than we can get from one person or group of people alone,<br>
      more than we can ever borrow!
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreso, we can all agree, that Nigeria deserves better,<br>
      better than corrupt people eating away every bit of<br>
      our individual and collective efforts to be hardworking,<br>
      better than to be the land of frustrated and wasted youth,<br>
      better than to be the land of abandoned educational institutions,<br>
      better than to be the home of greener pasture seekers,<br>
      better than to be the impoverished goose that lays the golden egg,<br>
      better than to be the market for global waste in disguise,<br>
      better than to be the place for abbandoned factories,<br>
      better than to be the place rejected by its own people,<br>
      better than a place where the price of everything else<br>
      depends on the price of oil.

      How?
      <article class="vision">
      1. INTEGRITY, TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY <br>
      2. ECONOMY RESCUE AND ENHANCEMENT  <br>
      3. ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT <br>
      4. CITIZEN WELFARE AND DEVELOPMENT <br>
      5. FAIR RESTRUCTURING OF RESOURCE ALLOCATION PER SQUARE METRE PER HEAD-COUNT <br>
      </article>
    <h2>OUR NEEDS</h2>
        1. HEALTHCARE <br>
        2. EDUCATION <br>
        3. SECURITY <br>
        4. ELECTRICITY <br>
        5. WATER <br>
        6. ROADS <br>

    <br>
    From 2019 to 2023, we have to move these sectors to operate at<br>
    ninety nine (99) percent capacity by our own innovation and<br>
    productivity we reverse engineer known inventions and invent<br>
    the unknown as the need arises, very importantly we must do <br>
    this ourselves using our own means to arrive at the desired<br>
    piece of technology. Then begin to look to the future of our dear country.<br>

    <h2>The Economic Dilema</h2>
    The solution to the economic crisis is simple its a little bit too simple that most<br>
    people don't see it as though it were hidden in plain sight<br>
    and the few who do write it off as easier said than done.<br>
    <br>
    Every country has a net worth that defines it's currency strength that is defined by:<br>
    1. How much land it owns and how it cares for it and what goes on there (real estate and security).<br>
    2. How much profit it is capable of making on the cost of producing<br>
       export quantity and quality (with no lack of proper utilisation of these items<br>
       within the country or else profit margins drop by over ninety (90) percent) (industrialization).<br>
    3. Food: Grains, Tubers, Green Vegetables, Fruits and Animal Protein.<br>
    4. Electricity: Production via Dams, Solar, Nuclear, Particle, Kinesis.<br>
    5. Cotton, Animal Hyde.<br>
    6. And of course others like gold, diamonds, silver, petroleum, lithium, silicon, iron, cement.<br>
    7. How many people work together to produce and sell these items properly.<br>
    8. How intelligent and innovative these people are (workforce and army).<br>
    <br>
    Therefore my first duty to humanity and as president would be to<br>
    introduce a cloud based problem solution engine where every confirmed Nigerian<br>
    will have a say and an opportunity to make constructive input to the affairs of the country.<br>
    then to introduce innovative measures such as:

      <h2>Energy Generation</h2>
    1. Kinetic energy to electrical energy convertion technology<br>
    pads manufactured in nigeria that generate electricity while everyday people walk on them<br>
    on our streets to power the street lights, buldings and eventually entire communities.<br>
    2. Solar Panel Manufacturing: the semi conductor components and other raw materials are<br>
    readily available in Nigeria all we need is the will.<br>
    3. Wind turbine manufacturing and installation:

      <h2>Energy Storage</h2>
    1. We must commence immediate studies and manufacture of <br>
    super capacitor storage systems to store immense amounts of <br>
    electricity that can last decades but can be charged fully within seconds.<br>


    <br>
    Think of Nigeria as a tourist centre,<br>
    our business is getting people to come<br>
    in and enrich us while they enjoy themselves,<br>
    our job is to take care of and enhance our business.<br>
    As a multi-national corporation with all the products/produce<br>
    we Nigeria have to offer for example our job would be to find the<br>
    best ways to sell our products/produce and make our products better while<br>
    we are at it.<br>
    Even though in reality it is almost impossible to see Nigeria through such markspersonific eyes,<br>
    due to our ethnic and political landscapes being some of the most complex in the world if not the most<br>
    complex in the world!<br>
    The Nigeria landscape still remains in need of an innovative and creative united mind<br>
    so instead of excluding the Nigerian people from sensitive matters and decisions the Nigerian<br>
    gets the head seat at the discussion table.<br>
    This philiosophy is the basis behind my campaign <br>
    and it goes a long way to fuel my need to step up to enhance or create <br>
    not only a smarter Nigeria, but a smarter AWest-Africa and a smarter Africa. <br>
